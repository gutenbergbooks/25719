<p class="center"><i>To Mistress&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;.</i></p>

<p class="greeting">Respected Madam,</p>

<p>In compliance with your request I shall now transcribe from
the journal of my younger days some portions of my adventurous
life. When I wrote, I painted the feelings of my heart without
reserve, and I shall not alter one word, as I know you wish to
learn what my feelings were then, and not what my thoughts may
be now. They say that in every man&rsquo;s life, however obscure his
position may be, there would be a moral found, were it truly
told. I think, Madam, when you have perused what I am about
to write, you will agree with me, that, from my history, both
old and young may gather profit, and, I trust, if ever it should
be made public, that, by divine permission, such may be the
result. Without further preface, I shall commence with a narrative
of my cruise off Hispaniola, in the Revenge privateer.</p>

<p>The Revenge mounted fourteen guns, and was commanded
by Captain Weatherall, a very noted privateer&rsquo;s-man. One
morning at daybreak we discovered a vessel from the masthead,
and immediately made all sail in chase, crowding every stitch of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
canvas. As we neared, we made her out to be a large ship,
deeply laden, and we imagined that she would be an easy prize,
but as we saw her hull more out of the water she proved to be well
armed, having a full tier of guns fore and aft. As it afterwards
proved, she was a vessel of 600 tons burden, and mounted
twenty-four guns, having sailed from St. Domingo, and being
bound to France.</p>

<p>She had been chartered by a French gentleman (and a most
gallant fellow we found him), who had acquired a large fortune
in the West-Indies, and was then going home, having embarked
on board his whole property, as well as his wife and his only son,
a youth of about seventeen. As soon as he discovered what we
were, and the impossibility of escape from so fast a sailing vessel
as the Revenge, he resolved to fight us to the last. Indeed, he
had every thing to fight for; his whole property, his wife and his
only child, his own liberty, and perhaps life, were all at stake,
and he had every motive that could stimulate a man. As we
subsequently learnt, he had great difficulty in inspiring the crew
with an equal resolution, and it was not until he had engaged to
pay them the value of half the cargo provided they succeeded in
beating us off, and forcing their way in safety to France, that he
could rouse them to their duty.</p>

<p>Won by his example, for he told them that he did not desire
any man to do more than he would do himself, and perhaps more
induced by his generous offer, the French crew declared they
would support him to the last, went cheerfully to their guns and
prepared for action. When we were pretty near to him, he
shortened sail ready for the combat, having tenderly forced his
wife down below to await in agony the issue of a battle on which
depended every thing so dear to her. The resolute bearing of the
vessel, and the cool intrepidity with which they had hove to to
await us, made us also prepare on our side for a combat which
we knew would be severe. Although she was superior to us in
guns, yet the Revenge being wholly fitted for war, we had many
advantages, independent of our being very superior in men.
Some few chase-guns were fired during our approach, when,
having ranged up within a cable&rsquo;s length of her, we exchanged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
broadsides for half an hour, after which our captain determined
upon boarding. We ran our vessel alongside, and attempted to
throw our men on board, but met with a stout resistance. The
French gentleman, who was at the head of his men, with his own
hand killed two of our stoutest seamen, and mortally wounded a
third, and, encouraged by his example, his people fought with
such resolution, that after a severe struggle we were obliged to
give it up, and retreat precipitately into our own vessel, leaving
eight or ten of our shipmates weltering in their blood.</p>

<p>Our captain, who had not boarded with us, was much
enraged at our defeat, stigmatizing us as cowards for allowing
ourselves to be driven from a deck upon which we had obtained
a footing; he called upon us to renew the combat, and leading
the way, he was the first on board of the vessel, and was engaged
hand to hand with the brave French gentleman, who had already
made such slaughter among our men. Brave and expert with his
weapon as Captain Weatherall undoubtedly was, he for once
found rather more than a match in his antagonist; he was slightly
wounded, and would, I suspect, have had the worst of this
hand-to-hand conflict, had not the whole of our crew, who had
now gained the deck, and were rushing forward, separated him
from his opponent. Out-numbered and over-matched, the
French crew fought most resolutely, but notwithstanding their
exertions, and the gallant conduct of their leader, we succeeded
in driving them back to the quarter-deck of the vessel. Here the
combat was renewed with the greatest obstinacy, they striving to
maintain this their last hold, and we exerting ourselves to complete
our conquest. The Frenchmen could retreat no further,
and our foremost men were impelled against them by those behind
them crowding on to share in the combat. Retreat being
cut off, the French struggled with all the animosity and rage of
mingled hate and despair; while we, infuriated at the obstinate
resistance, were filled with vengeance and a thirst for blood.
Wedged into one mass, we grappled together, for there was
no room for fair fighting, seeking each other&rsquo;s hearts with
shortened weapons, struggling and falling together on the
deck, rolling among the dead and the dying, or trodden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
underfoot by the others who still maintained the combat with unabated
fury.</p>

<p>Numbers at last prevailed; we had gained a dear-bought
victory&mdash;we were masters of the deck, we had struck the colours,
and were recovering our lost breaths after this very severe
contest, and thought ourselves in full possession of the ship;
but it proved otherwise. The first lieutenant of the privateer and
six of us, had dashed down the companion, and were entering
the cabin in search of plunder, when we found opposed to our
entrance, the gallant French gentleman, supported by his son,
the captain of the vessel, and five of the French sailors; behind
them was the French gentleman&rsquo;s wife, to whose protection they
had devoted themselves. The lieutenant, who headed us, offered
them quarter, but stung to madness at the prospect of the ruin
and of the captivity which awaited him, the gentleman treated the
offer with contempt, and rushing forward attacked our lieutenant,
beating down his guard, and was just about to pierce him
with the lunge which he made, when I fired my pistol at him to
save the life of my officer. The ball entered his heart, and thus
died one of the bravest men I ever encountered. His son at the
same time was felled to the deck with a pole-axe, when the remainder
threw themselves down on the deck, and cried for
quarter. So enraged were our men at this renewal of the combat,
that it required all the efforts and authority of the lieutenant
to prevent them from completing the massacre by taking the lives
of those who no longer resisted. But who could paint the condition
of that unhappy lady who had stood a witness of the horrid
scene&mdash;her eyes blasted with the sight of her husband slain before
her face, her only son groaning on the deck and weltering in
his blood; and she left alone, bereft of all that was dear to her;
stripped of the wealth she was that morning mistress of, now a
widow, perhaps childless, a prisoner, a beggar, and in the
hands of lawless ruffians, whose hands were reeking with her
husband&rsquo;s and offspring&rsquo;s blood, at their mercy, and exposed
to every evil which must befal a beautiful and unprotected female
from those who were devoid of all principle, all pity, and all
fear! Well might the frantic creature rush, as she did, upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
our weapons, and seek that death which would have been a mercy
and a blessing. With difficulty we prevented her from injuring
herself, and, after a violent struggle, nature yielded, and she
sank down in a swoon on the body of her husband, dabbling her
clothes and hair in the gore which floated on the cabin-deck.
This scene of misery shocked even the actors in it. Our sailors,
accustomed as they were to blood and rapine, remained silent
and immoveable, resting upon their weapons, their eyes fixed
upon the unconscious form of that unhappy lady.</p>

<p>The rage of battle was now over, our passions had subsided,
and we felt ashamed of a conquest purchased with such unutterable
anguish. The noise of this renewed combat had brought
down the captain; he ordered the lady to be taken away from this
scene of horror, and to be carefully tended in his own cabin;
the wound of the son, who was found still alive, was immediately
dressed, and the prisoners were secured. I returned on deck,
still oppressed with the scene I had witnessed, and when I looked
round me, and beheld the deck strewed with the dead and dying&mdash;victors
and vanquished indiscriminately mixed up together&mdash;the
blood of both nations meeting on the deck and joining their
streams&mdash;I could not help putting the question to myself, &ldquo;Can
this be right and lawful&mdash;all this carnage to obtain the property
of others, and made legal by the quarrels of kings?&rdquo; Reason,
religion, and humanity, answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remained uneasy and dissatisfied, and felt as if I were a
murderer; and then I reflected how this property, thus wrested
from its former possessor, who might, if he had retained it,
have done much good with it, would now be squandered away in
riot and dissipation, in purchasing crime and administering to
debauchery. I was young then, and felt so disgusted and so
angry with myself and everybody else, that if I had been in
England, I probably should never again have put my foot on
board of a privateer.</p>

<p>But employment prevented my thinking; the decks had to be
cleaned, the bodies thrown overboard, the blood washed from
the white planks, the wounded to be removed, and their hurts
dressed, the rigging and other damages to be repaired, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
all this had been done, we made sail for Jamaica with our prize.
Our captain, who was as kind and gentle to the vanquished as he
was brave and resolute in action, endeavoured by all the means
he could think of to soften the captivity and sufferings of the lady.
Her clothes, jewels, and every thing belonging to her, were preserved
untouched; he would not even allow her trunks to be
searched, and would have secured for her even all her husband&rsquo;s
personal effects, but the crew had seized upon them as plunder,
and refused to deliver them up. I am almost ashamed to say that
the sword and watch of her husband fell to my lot, and whether
from my wearing the sword, or from having seen me fire the
pistol which had killed him, the lady always expressed her abhorrence
of me whenever I entered her presence. Her son recovered
slowly from his wound, and, on our arrival at Port Royal,
was permitted by the admiral to be sent to the King&rsquo;s Hospital,
and the lady, who was most tenderly attached to him, went on
shore and remained at the Hospital to attend upon him. I was
glad when she was gone, for I knew how much cause she had for
her hatred of me, and I could not see her without remorse. As
soon as we had completed our repairs, filled up our provisions
and water, we sailed upon another cruise, which was not so successful,
as you will presently perceive.</p>

<p>For five or six weeks we cruised without success, and our
people began to grumble, when one morning our boats in shore
off Hispaniola surprised a small schooner. A negro who was
among the prisoners offered to conduct us through the woods by
night to the house of a very rich planter, which was situated
about three miles from a small bay, and at some distance from
the other plantations. He asserted that we might there get very
valuable plunder, and, moreover, obtain a large ransom for the
planter and his family, besides bringing away as many of the
negro slaves as we pleased.</p>

<p>Our captain, who was tired of his ill-success, and who hoped
also to procure provisions, which we very much wanted, consented
to the negro&rsquo;s proposal, and standing down abreast of the
bay, which was in the Bight of Lugan, he ran in at dark, and
anchoring close to the shore, we landed with forty men, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
guided by the negro, we proceeded through the woods to the
house. The negro was tied fast to one of our stoutest and best
men, for fear he should give us the slip. It was a bright moonlight;
we soon arrived, and surrounding the house, forced our
way in without opposition. Having secured the negroes in the
out-houses, and placed guards over them, and videttes on the
look-out to give timely notice of any surprise, we proceeded to
our work of plunder. The family, consisting of the old planter
and his wife, and his three daughters, two of them very beautiful,
was secured in one room. No words can express their terror
at thus finding themselves so suddenly in the power of a set of
ruffians, from whose brutality they anticipated every evil. Indeed
the horrid excesses committed by the privateers&rsquo;-men, when
they landed on the coast, fully justified their fears, for as this
system of marauding is considered the basest of all modern warfare,
no quarter is ever given to those who are taken in the attempt.
In return, the privateers&rsquo;-men hesitate at no barbarity
when engaged in such enterprises.</p>

<p>Dumb with astonishment and terror, the old couple sat in silent
agony, while the poor girls, who had more evils than death
to fear, drowned in their tears, fell at the captain&rsquo;s feet and embraced
his knees, conjuring him to spare and protect them from
his men.</p>

<p>Captain Weatherall, who was, as I have before stated, a generous
and humane man, raised them up, assuring them, on
his word, that they should receive no insult, and as his presence
was necessary to direct the motions of his people, he selected me,
as younger and less brutal than most of his crew, as a guard over
them, menacing me with death if I allowed any man to enter the
room until he returned, and ordering me to defend them with my
life from all insults. I was then young and full of enthusiasm;
my heart was kind, and I was pure in comparison with the major
portion of those with whom I was associated.</p>

<p>I was delighted with the office confided to me, and my heart
leaped at having so honourable an employment. I endeavoured
by every means in my power to dissipate their terrors and soothe
their anxious minds; but while I was thus employed, an Irish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
seaman, distinguished even amongst our crew for his atrocities,
came to the door, and would have forced his entrance. I instantly
opposed him, urging the captain&rsquo;s most positive commands;
but, having obtained a sight of the young females, he
swore with a vile oath that he would soon find out whether a boy
like me was able to oppose him, and finding that I would not give
way, he attacked me fiercely. Fortunately, I had the advantage
of position, and supported by the justice of my cause, I repelled
him with success. But he renewed the attack, while the poor
young women awaited the issue of the combat with trembling
anxiety&mdash;a combat on which depended, in all probability, their
honour and their lives. At last I found myself very hard pushed,
for I had received a wound on my sword arm, and I drew a pistol
from my belt with my left-hand, and fired it, wounding him in
the shoulder. Thus disabled, and fearing at the same time that
the report would bring back the captain, whom he well knew
would not be trifled with, he retired from the door vowing
vengeance. I then turned to the young women, who had witnessed
the conflict in breathless suspense, encircled in the arms
of the poor old couple, who had rushed towards them at the commencement
of the fray, offering them their useless shelter. Privateer&rsquo;s-man
as I was, I could not refrain from tears at the scene.
I again attempted to reassure them, pledged myself in the most
solemn manner to forfeit my life if necessary for their protection,
and they in some degree regained their confidence. They observed
the blood trickling down my fingers from the wound
which I had received, and the poor girls stained their handkerchiefs
with it in the attempts to staunch the flow.</p>

<p>But this scene was soon interrupted by an alarm. It appeared
that a negro had contrived to escape and to rouse the country.
They had collected together from the other plantations, and our
party being, as is usually the case when plunder is going on,
very negligent, the videttes were surprised, and had hardly time
to escape and apprise us of our danger. There was not a moment
to be lost; our safety depended upon an immediate retreat.
The captain collected all hands, and while he was getting them
together that the retreat might be made in good order, the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
planter who, by the report of the fire-arms and the bustle and
confusion without, guessed what had taken place, pressed me to
remain with them, urging the certainty of our men being overpowered,
and the merciless consequences which would ensue.
He pledged himself with his fingers crossed in the form of the
crucifix, that he would procure me safe quarter, and that I should
ever enjoy his protection and friendship. I refused him kindly
but firmly, and he sighed and said no more. The old lady put a
ring on my finger, which she took from her own hand, and kissing
my forehead, told me to look at that ring, and continue to do
good and act nobly as I had just done.</p>

<p>I waved my hand, for I had no time even to take the proffered
hands of the young ones, and hastened to join my shipmates already
on the retreat, and exchanging shots with our pursuers.
We were harassed by a multitude, but they were a mixed company
of planters, mulattoes, and slaves, and not half of them
armed, and we easily repelled their attacks, whenever they came
to close quarters. Their violent animosity, however, against us
and our evil doings, induced them to follow close at our heels,
keeping up a galling irregular fire, and endeavouring to detain
us until we might be overpowered by their numbers, every minute
increasing, for the whole country had been raised, and were
flocking in. This our captain was well aware of, and therefore
made all the haste that he could, without disturbing the regularity
of his retreat, to where our boats were lying, as should
they be surprised and cut off, our escape would have been impossible.
Notwithstanding all his care, several of our men were
separated from us by the intricacies of the wood, or from wounds
which they had received, and which prevented them from keeping
up with us. At last, after repelling many attacks, each time
more formidable than the preceding, we gained our boats, and
embarking with the greatest precipitation, we put off for the
schooner. The enemy, emboldened by our flight, flocked down
in great numbers to the water&rsquo;s edge, and we had the mortification
to hear our stragglers, who had been captured, imploring
for mercy; but groans and then silence too plainly informed us
that mercy had been denied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
Captain Weatherall was so enraged at the loss of his men
that he ordered us to pull back and attack the enemy on the
beach, but we continued to pull for the schooner, regardless of
his threats and entreaties. A panic had seized us all, as well it
might. We even dreaded the ill-aimed and irregular fire which
they poured upon us, which under other circumstances would
have occasioned only laughter. The schooner had been anchored
only two hundred yards from the beach, and we were soon on
board. They continued to fire from the shore, and the balls
passed over us. We put a spring upon our cable, warped our
broadside to the beach, and loading every gun with grape and
cannister, we poured a whole broadside upon our assailants.
From the shrieks and cries, the carnage must have been very
great. The men would have reloaded and fired again, but the
captain forbade them, saying, &ldquo;We have done too much already.&rdquo;
I thought so too. He then ordered the anchor to be
weighed, and with a fresh land-breeze, we were soon far away
from this unlucky spot.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class="chaphead"><p>We are pursued by Two Schooner-Privateers, and failing to escape
them a terrible Contest ensues&mdash;Three Acts of a Murderous Naval
Drama&mdash;We are worsted&mdash;Captain Weatherall is killed&mdash;I am
plundered and wounded.</p></div>


<p>About six weeks after the unlucky affair before described, we
met with a still greater disaster. We had cruised off the Spanish
Main and taken several prizes; shortly after we had manned the
last and had parted company, the Revenge being then close in
shore, a fresh gale sprung up, which compelled us to make all
sail to clear the land. We beat off shore during the whole of the
night, when the weather moderated, and at daybreak we found
out that we had not gained much offing, in consequence of the
current; but what was more important, the man who went to the
look-out at the masthead, hailed the deck, saying there were
two sail in the offing. The hands were turned up to make sail in
chase, but we found that they were resolutely bearing down upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
us; and as we neared each other fast, we soon made them out to
be vessels of force. One we knew well&mdash;she was the Esperance,
a French schooner-privateer of sixteen guns, and one
hundred and twenty-men; the other proved to be a Spanish
schooner-privateer, cruising in company with her, of eighteen
guns, and full manned.</p>

<p>Now our original complement of men had been something
more than one hundred, but by deaths, severe wounds in action,
and manning our prizes, our actual number on board was reduced
to fifty-five effective men. Finding the force so very superior,
we made every attempt with sails and sweeps to escape, but
the land to leeward of us, and their position to windward,
rendered it impossible. Making, therefore, a virtue of necessity,
we put a good face upon it, and prepared to combat against
such desperate odds.</p>

<p>Captain Weatherall, who was the life and soul of his crew,
was not found wanting on such an emergency. With the
greatest coolness and intrepidity, he gave orders to take in all
the small sails, and awaited the coming down of the enemy.
When every thing was ready for the unequal conflict, he ordered
all hands aft, and endeavoured to inspire us with the same
ardour which animated himself. He reminded us that we had
often fought and triumphed over vessels of much greater force
than our own; that we had already beaten off the French privateer
on a former occasion; that the Spaniard was not worth talking
about except to swell the merits of the double victory, and that
if once we came hand to hand our cutlasses would soon prove our
superiority. He reminded us that our only safety depended
upon our own manhood; for we had done such mischief on the
coast, and our recent descent upon the plantation was considered
in such a light, that we must not expect to receive quarter if we
were overcome. Exhorting us to behave well, and to fight
stoutly, he promised us the victory. The men had such confidence
in the captain that we returned him three cheers, when, dismissing
us to our quarters, he ordered St. George&rsquo;s ensign to be
hoisted at the main-masthead, and hove to for the enemy.</p>

<p>The French schooner was the first which ranged up alongside;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
the wind was light, and she came slowly down to us. The captain
of her hailed, saying that his vessel was the Esperance, and
our captain replied that he knew it, and that they also knew that
his was the Revenge. The French captain, who had hove to,
replied very courteously that he was well aware what vessel it
was, and also of the valour and distinguished reputation of Captain
Weatherall, upon which, Captain Weatherall, who stood
on the gunnel, took off his hat in acknowledgment of the compliment.</p>

<p>Now Captain Weatherall was well known, and it was also well
known that the two vessels would meet with a severe resistance,
which it would be as well to avoid, as even if they gained the
victory, it would not be without great loss of men. The French
captain therefore addressed Captain Weatherall again, and said
he hoped, now that he was opposed to so very superior a force,
he would not make a useless resistance, but as it would be no
disgrace to him, and would save the lives of many of his brave
men, his well known humanity would induce him to strike his
colours.</p>

<p>To this request our commander gave a gallant and positive refusal.
The vessels lay now close to each other, so that a biscuit
might have been thrown on board of either. A generous expostulation
ensued, which continued till the Spanish vessel was a short
distance astern of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You now see our force,&rdquo; said the French captain. &ldquo;Do not
fight against impossible odds, but spare your brave and devoted
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In return for your kind feeling towards me,&rdquo; replied Captain
Weatherall, &ldquo;I offer you both quarter, and respect to private
property, upon hauling down your colours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mad, Captain Weatherall,&rdquo; said the French captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You allow that I have lived bravely,&rdquo; replied Captain
Weatherall; &ldquo;you shall find that I will conquer you, and if necessary
I will also die bravely. We will now fight. In courtesy, I
offer you the first broadside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said the French captain, taking off his hat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
Our captain returned the salute, and then slipping down from
the gunwale, ordered the sails to be filled, and, after a minute to
give the Frenchman time to prepare, he fired off in the air the
fusee, which he held in his hand, as a signal for the action to
begin. We instantly commenced the work of death by pouring in
a broadside. It was returned with equal spirit, and a furious
cannonading ensued for several minutes, when the Spaniard
ranged up on our lee quarter with his rigging full of men to board
us. Clapping our helm a-weather and hauling our fore sheets to
windward, we fell off athwart his hawse, and raked him with
several broadsides fore and aft; our guns having been loaded
with langridge and lead bullets, and his men being crowded
together forward, ready to leap on board of us, her deck became a
slaughter-house. The officers endeavoured in vain to animate
their men, who, instead of gaining our decks, were so intimidated
by the carnage that they forsook their own. The Frenchman
perceiving the consternation and distress of his consort, to give
her an opportunity of extricating herself from her perilous condition,
now put his helm a-weather, ran us on board, and poured
in his men; but we were well prepared, and soon cleared our
decks of the intruders. In the meantime the Spaniard, by cutting
away our rigging, in which his bowsprit was entangled, swung
clear of us, and fell away to leeward. The Frenchman perceiving
this, sheered off, and springing his luff, shot ahead clear of us.
Such was the first act of this terrible drama. We had as yet sustained
little damage, the enemy&rsquo;s want of skill and our own good
fortune combined, having enabled us to take them at such a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>But although inspirited by such a prosperous beginning, our
inferiority in men was so great that our captain considered it his
duty to make all sail in hopes of being able to avoid such an
unequal combat. This our enemies attempted to prevent by a
most furious cannonade, which we received and returned without
flinching, making a running fight of it, till at last our fore yard
and foretop-mast being shot away, we had no longer command
of the vessel. Finding that, although we were crippled and could
not escape, our fire continued unabated, both the vessels again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
made preparations for boarding us, while we on our part prepared
to give them a warm reception.</p>

<p>As we knew that the Frenchman, who was our most serious
opponent, must board us on our weather bow, we traversed over
four of our guns loaded to the muzzle with musket balls to receive
him, and being all ready with our pateraroes and hand grenades,
we waited for the attack. As he bore down for our bows, with
all his men clinging like bees, ready for the spring, our guns
were discharged and the carnage was terrible. The men staggered
back, falling down over those who had been killed or wounded,
and it required all the bravery and example of the French captain,
who was really a noble fellow, to rally the remainder of his men,
which at last he succeeded in doing, and about forty of them
gained our forecastle, from which they forced our weak crew, and
retained possession, not following up the success, but apparently
wailing till they were seconded by the Spaniard&rsquo;s boarding us on
our lee quarter, which would have placed us between two fires,
and compelled us to divide our small force.</p>

<p>By this time the wind, which had been light, left us, and it
was nearly a calm, with a swell on the sea, which separated the
two vessels; the Spaniard, who was ranging up under our lee,
having but little way and not luffing enough, could not fetch us,
but fell off and drifted to leeward. The Frenchmen who had been
thrown on board, and who retained possession of our forecastle,
being thus left without support from their own vessel, which had
been separated from us by the swell, or from the Spaniard, which
had fallen to leeward, we gave three cheers, and throwing a
number of hand-grenades in among them, we rushed forward
with our half-pikes, and killed or drove every soul of them overboard,
one only, and he wounded in the thigh, escaped by
swimming back to his own vessel. Here, then, was a pause in
the conflict, and thus ended, I may say, the second act.</p>

<p>Hitherto the battle had been fought with generous resolution;
but after this hand-to-hand conflict, and the massacre with which
it ended, both sides appeared to have been roused to ferocity. A
most infernal cannonade was now renewed by both our antagonists,
and returned by us with equal fury; but it was now a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
dead calm, and the vessels rolled so much with the swell, that
the shot were not so effective. By degrees we separated more and
more from our enemies, and the firing was now reduced to single
guns. During this partial cessation our antagonists had drawn
near to each other, although at a considerable distance from us.
We perceived that the Spaniard was sending two of his boats full
of men to supply the heavy loss sustained by his comrade. Captain
Weatherall ordered the sweeps out, and we swept our broadside
to them, trying by single guns to sink the boats as they went
from one vessel to the other. After two or three attempts, a
gun was successful; the shot shattered the first of the boats,
which instantly filled and went down. The second boat pulled
up and endeavoured to save the men, but we now poured our
broadside upon them, and, daunted by the shot flying about
them, they sought their own safety by pulling back to the vessel,
leaving their sinking companions to their fate. Failing in this
attempt, both vessels recommenced their fire upon us, but the
distance and the swell of the sea prevented any execution, and
at last they ceased firing, waiting till a breeze should spring
up which might enable them to renew the contest with better
success.</p>

<p>At this time it was about eleven o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon, and
the combat had lasted about five hours. We refreshed ourselves
after the fatigue and exertion which we had undergone, and made
every preparation for a renewal of the fight. During the engagement
we were so excited, that we had no time to think; but
now that we were cool again and unoccupied, we had time to
reflect upon our position, and we began to feel dejected and apprehensive.
Fatigued with exertion, we were weak and dispirited.
We knew that our best men were slain or groaning under their
severe wounds, that the enemy were still numerous, and as they
persevered after so dreadful a slaughter, that they were of unquestionable
bravery and resolution. Good fortune, and our
captain&rsquo;s superior seamanship had, up to the present, enabled
us to make a good fight, but fortune might desert us, and our
numbers were so reduced, that if the enemy continued resolute,
we must be overpowered. Our gallant captain perceived the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
despondency that prevailed, and endeavoured to remove it by his
own example and by persuasion. After praising us for the resolution
and courage we had already shown, he pointed out to us
that whatever might be the gallantry of the officers, it was clear
that the men on board of the opposing vessels were awed by their
heavy loss and want of success, and that if they made one more
attempt to take us by the board and failed, which he trusted they
would do, no persuasion would ever induce them to try it again,
and the captains of the vessels would give over such an unprofitable
combat. He solemnly averred that the colours should
never be struck while he survived, and demanded who amongst
us were base enough to refuse to stand by them. Again we gave
him three cheers, but our numbers were few, and the cheers
were faint compared with the first which had been given, but still
we were resolute, and determined to support our captain and the
honour of our flag. Captain Weatherall took care that this feeling
should not subside&mdash;he distributed the grog plentifully; at our
desire he nailed the colours to the mast, and we waited for a
renewal of the combat with impatience. At four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon a breeze sprang up, and both vessels trimmed their
sails and neared us fast&mdash;not quite in such gallant trim as in the
morning it is true&mdash;but they appeared now to have summoned
up a determined resolution. Silently they came up, forcing their
way slowly through the water; not a gun was fired, but the gaping
mouths of the cannon, and their men motionless at their quarters,
portended the severity of the struggle which was now to
decide this hitherto well-contested trial for victory. When within
half a cable&rsquo;s length, we saluted them with three cheers, they
returned our defiance, and running up on each side of us, the
combat was renewed with bitterness.</p>

<p>The Frenchman would not this time lay us on board until he
was certain that the Spaniard had boarded us to leeward&mdash;he
continued luffing to windward and plying us with broadsides until
we were grappled with the Spaniard, and then he bore down and
laid his gunwale on our bow. The Spaniard had already boarded
us on the quarter, and we were repelling this attack, when the
Frenchman laid us on the bow. We fought with desperation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
and our pikes gave us such an advantage over the swords and
knives of the Spaniards, that they gave ground, and appalled by
the desperate resistance they encountered, quitted our decks
strewed with their dead and dying shipmates, and retreated in
confusion to their own vessel. But before this repulse had been
effected, the French had boarded us on the weather-bow, and
driving before them the few men who had been sent forward
to resist them, had gained our main deck, and forced their way
to the rise of the quarter-deck, where all our remaining men
were now collected. The combat was now desperate, but after a
time our pikes, and the advantage of our position, appeared to
prevail over numbers. We drove them before us&mdash;we had regained
the main deck, when our brave commander, who was at
our head, and who had infused spirit into us all, received a
bullet through his right wrist; shifting his sword into his left
hand, he still pressed forward encouraging us, when a ball entered
his breast and he dropped dead. With his fall, fell the
courage and fortitude of his crew so long sustained&mdash;and to
complete the mischief, the lieutenant and two remaining officers
also fell a few seconds after him. Astonished and terrified, the
men stopped short in their career of success, and wildly looked
round for a leader. The French, who had retreated to the forecastle,
perceiving our confusion, renewed the attack, our few
remaining men were seized with a panic, and throwing down our
arms, we asked for quarter where a moment before victory was
in our hands&mdash;such was the finale of our bloody drama.</p>

<p>Out of fifty-five men twenty-two had been killed in this murderous
conflict, and almost all the survivors desperately or severely
wounded. Most of the remaining crew after we had cried
for quarter jumped down the hatchway, to avoid the cutlasses of
their enraged victors. I and about eight others, having been driven
past the hatchway, threw down our arms and begged for quarter,
which we had little reason to expect would be shown to us. At
first no quarter was given by our savage enemies, who cut down
several of our disarmed men and hacked them to pieces. Perceiving
this, I got on the gunwale ready to jump overboard, in
the hopes of being taken up after the slaughter had ceased, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
a French lieutenant coming up protected us, and saved the poor
remains of our crew from the fury of his men. Our lives, however,
were all he counted upon preserving&mdash;we were instantly stripped
and plundered without mercy. I lost every thing I possessed;
the watch, ring, and sword I had taken from the gallant Frenchman
were soon forced from me, and not stripping off my apparel
fast enough to please a Mulatto sailor, I received a blow with the
butt-end of a pistol under the left ear, which precipitated me down
the hatchway, near which I was standing, and I fell senseless
into the hold.</p>

French&mdash;I am taken to the hospital at Port Royal, where I meet the
French lady&mdash;Her savage exultation at my condition&mdash;She is punished
by one of my comrades.</p></div>


<p>On coming to my senses, I found myself stripped naked, and
suffering acute pain. I found that my right arm was broken, my
shoulder severely injured by my fall; and as I had received
three severe cutlass-wounds during the action, I had lost so
much blood that I had not strength to rise or do any thing for
myself. There I lay, groaning and naked, upon the ballast
of the vessel, at times ruminating upon the events of the action,
upon the death of our gallant commander, upon the loss
of our vessel, of so many of our comrades, and of our liberty.
After some time the surgeon, by the order of the French commander,
came down to dress my wounds. He treated me with the
greatest barbarity. As he twisted about my broken limb I could
not help crying at the anguish which he caused me. He compelled
me to silence by blows and maledictions, wishing I had broken
my rascally neck rather than he should have been put to the
trouble of coming down to dress me. However, dress me he did,
out of fear of his captain, who, he knew well, would send round
to see if he had executed his orders, and then he left me with a
kick in the ribs by way of remembrance. Shortly afterwards the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
vessels separated. Fourteen of us, who were the most severely
hurt, were left in the Revenge, which was manned by an officer
and twenty Frenchmen, with orders to take her into Port-au-Paix.
The rest of our men were put on board of the French privateer,
who sailed away in search of a more profitable adventure.</p>

<p>About an hour after they had made sail on the vessel, the officer
who had charge of her, looking down the hatchway, and perceiving
my naked and forlorn condition, threw me a pair of
trousers, which had been rejected by the French seamen as not
worth having, and a check shirt, in an equally ragged condition,
I picked up in the hold; this, with a piece of old rope to tie round
my neck as a sling for my broken arm, was my whole wardrobe.
In the evening I gained the deck, that I might be refreshed by
the breeze, which cooled my feverish body and somewhat
restored me.</p>

<p>We remained in this condition for several days, tortured
with pain, but more tortured, perhaps, by the insolence and
bragging of the Frenchmen, who set no bounds to their triumph
and self-applause. Among those who had charge of the prize
were two, one of whom had my watch and the other my ring;
the first would hold it to me grinning, and asking if Monsieur
would like to know what o&rsquo;clock it was; and the other would display
the ring, and tell me that his sweetheart would value it
when she knew that it was taken from a conquered Englishman.
This was their practice every day, and I was compelled to receive
their gibes without venturing a retort.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day after our capture, when close to Port-au-Paix,
and expecting we should be at anchor before nightfall,
we perceived a great hurry and confusion on deck; they were
evidently making all the sail that they could upon the vessel; and
then hearing them fire off their stern-chasers, we knew for
certain that they were pursued. Overjoyed at the prospect of
being released, we gave three cheers. The French from the deck
threatened to fire down upon us, but we knew that they dared not,
for the Revenge was so crippled in the fight, that they could not
put sail upon her so as to escape, and their force on board was
too small to enable them to resist if overtaken&mdash;we therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
continued our exulting clamours. At last we heard guns fired,
and the shot whizzing over the vessel&mdash;a shot or two struck our
hull, and soon afterwards a broadside being poured into us, the
Frenchmen struck their colours, and we had the satisfaction of
seeing all these Gasconaders driven down into the hold to take
our places. It was now their turn to be dejected and downcast,
and for us to be merry; and now also the tables had to be turned,
and we took the liberty of regaining possession of our clothes and
other property which they carried on their backs and in their
pockets. I must say we showed them no mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it, Monsieur?&rdquo; said I to the fellow who
had my watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your service, Sir,&rdquo; he replied, humbly taking out my
watch, and presenting it to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, taking the watch, and saluting him
with a kick in the stomach, which made him double up and turn
round from me, upon which I gave him another kick in the rear
to straighten him again. &ldquo;That ring, Monsieur, that your
sweetheart will prize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; replied the fellow, abjectly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sir,&rdquo; I replied, saluting him with the double
kick which I had given to the former. &ldquo;Tell your sweetheart I
sent her those,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that is, when you get back to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark ye, brother,&rdquo; cries one of our men, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble
you for that jacket which you borrowed of me the other day, and
in return here are a pair of iron garters (holding out the shackles),
which you must wear for my sake&mdash;I think they will fit you
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mounseer,&rdquo; cries another, &ldquo;that wig of mine don&rsquo;t suit
your complexion, I&rsquo;ll trouble you for it. It&rsquo;s a pity such a face
as yours should be disfigured in those curls. And while you are
about it, I&rsquo;ll thank you to strip altogether, as I think your
clothes will fit me, and are much too gay for a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was left naked through your kindness the other day,&rdquo; said
I to another, who was well and smartly dressed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you
to strip to your skin, or you shall have no skin left.&rdquo; And I commenced
with my knife cutting his ears as if I would skin them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
It was a lucky hit of mine, for in his sash I found about
twenty doubloons. He would have saved them, and held them tight,
but after my knife had entered his side about half an inch, he
surrendered the prize. After we had plundered and stripped
them of every thing, we set to to kick them, and we did it for half
an hour so effectually that they were all left groaning in a heap on
the ballast, and we then found our way on deck.</p>

<p>The privateer which had recaptured us proved to be the Hero,
of New Providence; the Frenchmen were taken out, and some of
her own men put in to take us to Port Royal; we being wounded,
and not willing to join her, remained on board. On our arrival at
Port Royal, we obtained permission to go to the King&rsquo;s Hospital to
be cured. As I went up stairs to the ward allotted to me, I met
the French lady whose husband had been killed, and who was
still nursing her son at the hospital, his wounds not having been
yet cured. Notwithstanding my altered appearance, she knew
me again immediately, and seeing me pale and emaciated, with
my arm in a sling, she dropped down on her knees and thanked
God for returning upon our heads a portion of the miseries we
had brought upon her. She was delighted when she heard how
many of us had been slain in the murderous conflict, and even
rejoiced at the death of poor Captain Weatherall, which, considering
how very kind and considerate he had been to her, I thought
to be very unchristian.</p>

<p>It so happened that I was not only in the same ward, but in
the cradle next to her son, and the excitement I had been under
when we were recaptured, and my exertion in kicking the Frenchmen,
had done me no good. A fever was the consequence, and I suffered
dreadfully, and she would look at me, exulting in my agony,
and mocking my groans, till at last the surgeon told her it was by
extreme favour that her son had been admitted into the hospital instead
of being sent to prison, and that if she did not behave herself
in a proper manner, he would order her to be denied admittance
altogether, and that if she dared to torment suffering men in that
way, on the first complaint on my part, her son should go to the
gaol and finish his cure there. This brought her to her senses,
and she begged pardon, and promised to offend no more, but she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
did not keep her word for more than a day or two, but laughed
out loud when the surgeon was dressing my arm, for a piece of
bone had to be taken out, and I shrieked with anguish. This
exasperated one of my messmates so much that, not choosing to
strike her, and knowing how to wound her still worse, he drove
his fist into the head of her son as he lay in his cradle, and by so
doing re-opened the wound that had been nearly healed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s pain for you to laugh at, you French devil,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>And sure enough it cost the poor young man his life.</p>

<p>The surgeon was very angry with the man, but told the French
lady as she kneeled sobbing by the side of her son, that she had
brought it upon herself and him by her own folly and cruelty.
I know not whether she felt so, or whether she dreaded a repetition,
but this is certain, she tormented me no more. On the
contrary, I think she suffered very severely, as she perceived that I
rapidly mended, and that her poor son got on but slowly. At
last my hurts were all healed, and I left the hospital, hoping never
to see her more.</p>

<p>A great deal of prize-money being due to us, I called upon
the agent at Port Royal to obtain an advance. I found him in a
puzzle. Owing to the death of Captain Weatherall and so many
of the officers, he hardly knew whether those who applied
to him were entitled to prize-money or not. Whether he
thought I appeared more honest than the others, or from what
cause I know not, he requested me, as I knew every thing
that had passed, to remain with him for a short time; and finding
that I could read and write well, he obtained from me correct lists
of the privateer&rsquo;s crew, with those who were killed, and on what
occasion. All this information I was able to give him, as well
as the ratings of the parties; for on more than one occasion the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
privateers&rsquo;-men had come to him representing themselves as
petty officers, when they were only common seamen on board,
and had in consequence received from him a larger advance than
they were entitled to. As soon as his accounts were pretty well
made up, he asked me whether I intended to go to England, as
if so, he would send me home with all the papers and documents
to the owner at Liverpool, who would require my assistance to
arrange the accounts; and as I had had quite enough of privateering
for a time, I consented to go. About two months after
leaving the hospital, during which I had passed a very pleasant
life, and quite recovered from my wounds and injuries, I sailed
for Liverpool in the Sally and Kitty West-Indiaman, commanded
by Captain Clarke, a very violent man.</p>

<p>We had not sailed twelve hours before we fell in with a gale,
which lasted several days, and we kept under close-reef-topsails
and storm-staysails. The gale lasting a week, raised a mountainous
swell, but it was very long and regular. On the seventh
day the wind abated, but the swell continued, and at evening
there was very little wind, when a circumstance occurred which
had nearly cost me my life, as you will acknowledge, Madam,
when I relate the story to you. During the dog-watch between
six and eight, some hands being employed in the foretop, the
other watch below at supper, and the captain and all the officers
in the cabin, I being at the helm, heard a voice apparently rising
out of the sea, calling me by name. Surprised, I ran to the side
of the ship, and saw a youth named Richard Pallant in the water
going astern. He had fallen out of the forechains, and knowing
that I was at the helm, had shouted to me for help. I immediately
called all hands, crying a man overboard. The captain
hastened on deck with all the others, and ordered the helm a-lee.
The ship went about, and then fell round off, driving fast before
the swell, till at last we brought her to.</p>

<p>The captain, although a resolute man, was much confused
and perplexed at the boy&rsquo;s danger&mdash;for his friends were people
of property at Ipswich, and had confided the boy to his particular
care. He ran backwards and forwards, crying out that the boy
must perish, as the swell was so high that he dared not send a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
boat, for the boat could not live in such a sea, and if the boat
were lost with the crew, there would not be hands enow left on
board to take the vessel home. As the youth was not a hundred
yards from the vessel, I stated the possibility of swimming to
him with the deep-sea line, which would be strong enough to haul
both him and the man who swam to him on board. Captain
Clarke, in a great rage, swore that it was impossible, and asked
me who the devil would go. Piqued at his answer, and anxious
to preserve the life of the youth, I offered to try it myself. I stripped,
and making the line fast round my body, plunged from the
ship&rsquo;s side into the sea. It was a new deep-sea line, and stiff in
the coil, so that not drawing close round me, it slipped, and I
swam through it, but catching it as it slipped over my feet, I made
it secure by putting my head and one arm through the noose. I
swam direct for the boy, and found that I swam with ease, owing
to the strength and buoyant nature of the water in those latitudes.
I had not swum more than half-way before the line got foul on
the coil on board, and checking me suddenly, it pulled me backwards
and under water. I recovered myself, and struck out
again. During this time, to clear the line on board, they had cut
some of the entangled parts, and in the confusion and hurry,
severed the wrong part, so that the end went overboard, and I had
half the coil of line hanging to me, and at the same time was
adrift from the ship. They immediately hailed me to return, but
from the booming of the waves I could not hear what they said,
and thought that they were encouraging me to proceed. I shouted
in return to show the confidence which I had in myself. I easily
mounted the waves as they breasted me, but still I made my way
very slowly against such a swell, and saw the boy only at intervals
when I was on the top of the wave. He could swim very little,
and did not make for the ship, but with his eyes fixed upon the
sky, paddled like a dog to keep himself above water. I now
began to feel the weight of the line upon me, and to fear that I
should never hold out. I began to repent of my rashness, and
thought I had only sacrificed myself without any chance of saving
him. I persevered, nevertheless, and having, as I guessed, come
to the spot where the boy was, I looked round, and not seeing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
him, was afraid that he had gone down, but on mounting the next
wave, I saw him in the hollow, struggling hard to keep above
water, and almost spent with his long exertion.</p>

<p>I swam down to him, and hailing him, found he was still
sensible, but utterly exhausted. I desired him to hold on by my
hand but not to touch my body, as we should both sink. He promised
to obey me, and I held out my right-hand to him, and made
a signal for them to haul in on board, for I had no idea that the
line had been cut. I was frightened when I perceived the
distance that the ship was from me&mdash;at least a quarter of a mile.
I knew that the deep-sea line was but a hundred fathoms in
length, and therefore that I must be adrift, and my heart sunk
within me. All the horrors of my situation came upon me, and
I felt that I was lost; but although death appeared inevitable, I
still struggled for life&mdash;but the rope now weighed me down more
and more. While swimming forward it trailed behind, and
although it impeded my way, I did not feel half its weight. Now,
however, that I was stationary, it sank deep, and pulled me down
with it. The waves, too, which, while I breasted them and saw
them approach, I easily rose over, being now behind us, broke
over our heads, burying us under them, or rolling us over by
their force.</p>

<p>I tried to disengage myself from the line, but the noose being
jammed, and having the boy in one hand, I could not possibly
effect it. But what gave me courage in my difficulties was, that I
perceived that the people on board were getting out the boat; for
although the captain would not run the risk for one person, now
that two were overboard, and one of them risking his life for the
other, the men insisted that the boat should be hoisted out. It
was an anxious time to me, but at last I had the satisfaction of
seeing her clear of the ship, and pulling round her bow. The
danger was, however, considered so great, that when they came
to man the boat, only three men could be found who would go in
her, and in the confusion they came away with but two oars and
no rudder. Under these disadvantages they of course pulled very
slowly against a mountainous sea, as they were obliged to steer
with the oars to meet it, that the boat might not be swamped.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
But the sight of the boat was sufficient to keep me up. My
exertions were certainly incredible; but what will not a man do
when in fear of death. As it approached&mdash;slowly and slowly did
my powers decrease. I was now often under water with the boy,
and rose again to fresh exertion, when at last a crested wave broke
over us, and down we went several feet under the water. The
force of the sea drove the boy against me, and he seized me by
the loins with my head downwards. I struggled to disengage
myself! It was impossible. I gave myself up for lost&mdash;and
what a crowd of thoughts, and memories passed through my
brain in a few moments, for it could not have been longer. At
last, being head downwards, I dived deeper, although I was
bursting from so long holding my breath under water.</p>

<p>This had the desired effect. Finding me sinking instead of
rising with him, the boy let go his hold that he might gain the
surface. I turned and followed him, and drew breath once more.
Another moment had sealed our fates. I no longer thought of
saving the boy, but struck out for the boat which was now near
me. Perceiving this, the boy cried out to me for pity&rsquo;s sake not
to leave him. I felt myself so far recovered from my exhaustion,
that I thought I could save him as well as myself, and compassion
induced me to turn back. I again gave him my hand, charging
him on his life not to attempt to grapple with me, and again
resumed the arduous struggle of keeping him as well as myself
above water. My strength was nearly gone, the boat approached
but slowly, and we now sunk constantly under the water, rising
every few seconds to draw breath. Merciful God! how slow appeared
the approach of the boat. Struggle after struggle&mdash;fainter
and fainter still&mdash;still I floated. At last my senses almost left
me, I took in water in quantities. I felt I was in green fields,
when I was seized by the men and thrown into the bottom of the
boat, where I lay senseless alongside of the boy. There was great
danger and difficulty in getting again to the ship. More than
once the boat was half filled by the following seas, and when they
gained the ship it was impossible to get us out, as, had they approached
the side, the boat would have been dashed to atoms.
They lowered the tackles from the yard-arms. The three men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
clambered up them, leaving us to take our chance of the boat
being got in, or her being stove to pieces; in which latter case,
we should have been lost. They did get us in, with great damage
to the boat, but we were saved. The line was still round me,
and it was found that I had been supporting the weight of seventy
yards. So sore was I with such exertion, that I kept my hammock
for many days, during which I reviewed my past life, and
vowed amendment.</p>

<p>We arrived at Liverpool without any further adventure worth
recording, and I immediately called upon the owner with the
papers intrusted to me. I gave him all the information he required,
and he asked me whether I should like to return to privateering,
or to go as mate of a vessel bound to the coast of
Africa. I inquired what her destination was to be, and as I
found that she was to go to Senegal for ivory, wax, gold dust, and
other articles, in exchange for English prints and cutlery, I consented.
I mention this, as, had she been employed in the slave-trade,
as were most of the vessels from Liverpool to the Coast, I
would not have joined her. A few days afterwards, I went on
board of the Dalrymple, Captain Jones, as mate; we had a very
quick passage to Senegal, and brought our vessel to an anchor off
the bar.</p>

female attendants.</p></div>


<p>A day or two after we had arrived, the master of another
vessel that was at anchor near to us came on board and borrowed
our long-boat and some hands that he might go in it to Senegal.
The captain, who was an old friend of the party who made the
request, agreed to lend it to him, and as accidents are very frequent
with boats crossing the bar, on account of the heavy breakers,
the best swimmers were selected for the purpose, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
charge of the boat was given to me. We set off, five men rowing
and I at the helm. When we approached the bar, a tornado,
which had been for some time threatening, came upon us. The
impetuosity of these blasts is to be matched in no part of the
world, and as it came at once in its full force, we endeavoured,
by putting the boat before it, to escape its fury. This compelled
us to run to the southward along the coast. We managed to keep
the boat up for a long while, and hoped to have weathered it,
when, being on the bar, and in broken water, a large wave curled
over us, filled the boat, and it went down in an instant.</p>

<p>Our only chance now was to reach the shore by swimming,
but it was at a distance, with broken water the whole way; and
our great terror was from the sharks, which abound on the coast
and are extremely ravenous&mdash;nor were we without reason for
our alarm. Scarcely had the boat gone down, and we were all
stretching out for the shore, when one of our men shrieked,
having been seized by the sharks, and instantly torn to pieces.
His blood stained the water all around, and this attracting all the
sharks proved the means of our escape. Never shall I forget the
horrible sensation which I felt as I struggled through the broken
water, expecting every minute a limb to be taken off by one of
those voracious animals. If one foot touched the other, my heart
sank, thinking it was the nose of a shark, and that its bite would
immediately follow. Agonized with these terrors, we struggled
on&mdash;now a large wave curling over us and burying us under
water, or now forced by the waves towards the beach, rolling us
over and over. So battered were we by the surf, that we dived
under the waves to escape the blows which we received, and then
rose and struck out again. At last, worn out with exertion, we
gained the shore, but our toil was not over.</p>

<p>The beach was of a sand so light that it crumbled beneath us,
and at the return of the wave which threw us on shore we were
dragged back again, and buried in sand and water. We rose to
renew our endeavours, but several times without success, for
we could not obtain a firm footing. At last the Negroes, who had
witnessed our accident, and who now came down in great numbers
on the beach, laid hold of us as the sea threw us up, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
dragged us beyond the reach of the waves. Worn out with fatigue
we lay on the sand, waiting to ascertain what the savages would
do with us; they were not long in letting us know, for they soon
began to strip us of every article of clothing on our backs. One of
our men attempted to resist, upon which a Negro drove a spear
through his thigh.</p>

<p>Having divided our apparel, after some consultation, they
tied our hands, and placing us in the midst of a large force,
armed with spears, and bows and arrows, they went off with us
for the inland part of the country. We set off with heavy hearts;
taking, as we thought, a last farewell of the ocean, and going
forwards in great apprehension of the fate that awaited us. The
sand was very deep, and the heat of the sun excessive, for it was
then about noon. Without any garments, we were soon scorched
and blistered all over, and in intolerable anguish, as well as
fatigued; but the Negroes compelled us to move on, goading us
with their spears if we slackened our pace, and threatening to run
us through if we made a halt. We longed for the night, as it
would afford a temporary relief to our sufferings. It came at last,
and the Negroes collected wood and lighted a fire to keep off the
wild beasts, lying round it in a circle, and placing us in the
midst of them. We hoped to have some rest after what we had
gone through, but it was impossible&mdash;the night proved even
worse than the day. The musquitoes came down upon us in such
swarms, and their bites were so intolerable that we were almost
frantic. Our hands being tied, we could not beat them off, and
we rolled over and over to get rid of them. This made matters
worse, for our whole bodies being covered with raised blisters
from the rays of the sun, our roiling over and over broke the
blisters, and the sand getting into the wounds, added to the bites
of the musquitoes, made our sufferings intolerable. We had
before prayed for night, we now prayed for day. Some prayed
for death.</p>

<p>When the sun rose, we set off again, our conductors utterly
disregarding our anguish, and goading us on as before. In the
forenoon we arrived at a village, where our guards refreshed
themselves; a very small quantity of boiled corn was given to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
each of us, and we continued our journey, passing by several
small towns, consisting, as they all do in that country, of huts
built of reeds, round in form, and gathered to a point at top.
This day was the same as the preceding. We were pricked with
spears if we stumbled or lagged, threatened with death if we had
not strength to go on. At last the evening arrived, and the fires
were lighted. The fires were much larger than before, I presume
because the wild beasts were more numerous, for we heard them
howling in every direction round us, which we had not done on
the night before. The musquitoes did not annoy us so much,
and we obtained some intervals of broken rest. At daylight we
resumed our journey, as near as we could judge by the sun, in a
more easterly direction.</p>

<p>During the first two days we were badly received by the inhabitants
of the towns, whose people had been kidnapped so
often for the slave-trade; they hated the sight of our white faces,
for they presumed that we had come for that purpose; but as we
advanced in the interior, we were better treated, and the natives
looked upon us with surprise and wonder, considering us as a
new race of beings. Some of the women seeing how utterly exhausted
we were with fatigue and hunger, looked with compassion
on us, and brought us plenty of boiled corn and goats&rsquo; milk to
drink. This refreshed us greatly, and we continued our journey
in anxious expectation of the fate for which we were reserved.</p>

<p>On crossing a small river, which appeared to be the boundary
of two different states, a multitude of Negroes approached, and
seemed disposed to take us from our present masters, but after
a conference, they agreed among themselves, and a party of them
joined with those who had previously conducted us. We soon
came to the edge of a desert, and there we halted till the Negroes
had filled several calabashes and gourds full of water, and collected
a quantity of boiled corn. As soon as this was done, we
set off again, and entered the desert. We were astonished and
terrified when we looked around us, not a single vestige of herbage,
not a blade of grass was to be seen&mdash;all was one wide waste
of barren sand, so light as to rise in clouds at the least wind, and
we sank so deep in walking through it that at last we could hardly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
drag one foot after the other. But we were repaid for our fatigue,
for when we halted at night, no fires were lighted, and to our
great delight we found that there were no musquitoes to annoy us.
We fell into a sound sleep, which lasted till morning, and were
much refreshed; indeed, so much so as to enable us to pursue
our journey with alacrity.</p>

<p>In our passage over the desert we saw numbers of elephants&rsquo;
teeth, but no animals. How the teeth came there, unless it were
that the elephants were lost in attempting to cross the desert, I
cannot pretend to say. Before we had crossed the desert, our water
was expended, and we suffered dreadfully from thirst, walking
as we did during the whole day under a vertical sun. The night
was equally painful, as we were so tortured with the want of
water; but on the following day, when our strength was nearly
exhausted, and we were debating whether we should not lie down
and allow the spears of our conductors to put an end to our miseries,
we came to the banks of a river which the Negroes had evidently
been anxiously looking for. Here we drank plentifully, and
remained all the day to recruit ourselves, for the Negroes were
almost as exhausted as we were. The next morning we crossed
the river, and plunged into a deep wood: the ground being high,
the musquitoes did not annoy us so much as they did down on the
low marshy land near the sea-coast. During our traverse through
the wood, we subsisted solely upon the birds and animals which
the Negroes killed with their bows and arrows.</p>

<p>When we had forced our way through the forest, we found
the country, as before, interspersed with wicker villages or
small hamlets at a few miles&rsquo; distance from each other. Round
each village there were small patches of Guinea corn, and we
frequently came to clusters of huts which had been deserted.
Between the sea-coast and the desert we had traversed we observed
that many of the inhabitants had European fire-arms, but
now the only weapons to be seen were spears and bows and
arrows. As we advanced we were surrounded at every village by
the natives, who looked upon us with surprise and astonishment,
examining us, and evidently considering us a new species. One
morning we arrived at a very large Negro town, and as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
approached, our guards began to swell with pride and exultation,
and drove us before them among the crowds of inhabitants, singing
songs of triumph, and brandishing their weapons. Having been
driven through a great part of the town, we arrived at a number
of huts separated by a high palisade from the rest, and appropriated,
as we afterwards found, to the use of the king of the
country, his wives and attendants. Here we waited outside some
time, while our guards went in and acquainted this royal personage
with the present which they had brought for him.</p>

<p>We had reason to think that our captors were not his subjects,
but had been at variance with him, and had brought us as a present,
that they might make peace with an enemy too strong for
them. We were at last ordered to go inside the inclosure, and
found ourselves in a large open building, constructed like the
others, of reeds and boughs. In the centre was squatted a
ferocious-looking old Negro, attended by four young Negro
women. He was raw-boned and lean, and of a very large frame.
A diabolical ferocity was imprinted on his grim countenance, and
as he moved his arms and legs he showed that under his loose
skin there was a muscle of extraordinary power. I never had
before seen such a living type of brutal strength and barbarity.
On a mat before him were provisions of different kinds. Behind
him stood several grim savages who held his weapons, and on
each side, at a greater distance, were rows of Negroes, with
their heads bent down and their arms crossed, awaiting his
orders. The chief or king, as well as the four women, had
clothes of the blue cotton cloth of the country, that is, one piece
wrapped round the loins and descending to the ankles, and
another worn over their shoulders; but, with few exceptions, all
the rest, as well as the inhabitants generally, were quite naked.
So were we, as the reader may recollect. Round the necks of
the women were rows of gold beads, longer by degrees, until
the last of the rows hung lower than their bosoms, and both the
king and they had large bracelets of gold round their arms,
wrists, and legs. The women, who were young and well-looking,
stared at us with eager astonishment, while the old
king scowled upon us so as to freeze our blood. At last, rising
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
from the ground, he took his sabre from the man who held it
behind him, and walked up among us, who with our heads
bowed, and breathless with fear, awaited our impending fate. I
happened to be standing the foremost, and grasping my arm with
a gripe which made my heart sink, with his hand which held the
sword he bent down my head still lower than it was. I made sure
that he was about to cut off my head, when the women, who had
risen from the ground, ran crowding round him, and with
mingled entreaties and caresses strove to induce him not to put
his intentions, if such he really had, into execution. They prevailed
at last; the youngest took away his sword, and then they
led him back to his seat, after which the women came to us to
gratify their curiosity. They felt our arms and breasts, putting
innumerable questions to those who brought us thither. They
appeared very much amazed at the length of my hair, for I had
worn it tied in a long cue. Taking hold of it, they gave it two or
three severe pulls, to ascertain if it really grew to my head, and
finding that it did so, they expressed much wonder. When
their curiosity was satisfied, they then appeared to consider our
condition, and having obtained the old king&rsquo;s permission, they
brought us a calabash full of cush-cush, that is Guinea corn
boiled into a thick paste. Our hands being still tied; we could
only by shaking our heads express our inability to profit by their
kindness. Understanding what we meant, they immediately cut
our thongs, and the youngest of the four perceiving that my arms
were benumbed from having been confined so many days, and
that I could not use them, showed the most lively commiseration
for my sufferings. She gently chafed my wrists with her hands,
and showed every sign of pity in her countenance, as indeed did
all the other three. But I was by far the youngest of the whole
party who had been captured, and seemed most to excite their
pity and good-will. Shortly afterwards we were all taken into an
adjoining tent or hut, and our bodies were rubbed all over with
an oil, which after a few days&rsquo; application left us perfectly
healed, and as smooth as silk. So altered was our condition,
that those very people who had guarded us with their spears and
threatened us with death, were now ordered to wait upon us, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
as the king&rsquo;s wives frequently came to see how we were treated,
we were served with the utmost humility and attention.</p>

<p>One morning, after we had been about three weeks in these
comfortable quarters, I was summoned away from my companions
into the presence of the king. When I came before him a
small manacle was fixed round my left ankle, and another round
my left wrist, with a light chain connecting the two. A circle of
feathers was put round my head, and a loose cloth wrapped round
my loins. I was then led forward to him with my arms crossed
over my breast, and my head bowed. By his orders I was then
placed behind the youngest of the four women, the one who had
chafed my wrists, and I was given to understand that I was her
slave, and was to attend upon her, to which, I must say, I gave
a joyful assent in my heart, although I did not at that time show
any signs of gladness. There I remained, with my arms folded,
and bowed as before, until dinner was brought in, and a calabash
full of cush-cush was put into my hands to place before the
king and his wives. My first attempt at service was not very
adroit, for, in my eagerness to do my duty, I tripped over the
corner of the mat which served them for a table, and tumbling
headlong forward, emptied the calabash of cush-cush which I
held in my hand upon the legs of the old king, who sat opposite
to where I was advancing. He jumped up roaring out with anger,
while I in my fear sprung on my legs, and rushed to the side of
the apartment, expecting immediate death. Fortunately the
victuals in this country are always served up cool, and my new
mistress easily obtained my pardon, laughing heartily at the
scene, and at my apprehension.</p>

<p>The repast being over, I was ordered to follow my mistress,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
who retired to another hut, according to their custom, to sleep
during the heat of the day. I was placed before the door to prevent
her being disturbed. My only duty now was to attend upon
my young mistress. She was the king&rsquo;s favourite wife, and as
she was uniformly kind and gentle, I should have almost ceased
to lament my loss of liberty had it not been from the fear I had of
the old monarch. I knew that my preservation depended entirely
upon my mistress&rsquo;s favour, and I endeavoured all I could to conciliate
her by the most sedulous attentions to please. Young and
generous in disposition, she was easily satisfied by my ready
obedience and careful service. I do not think that she was more
than seventeen years of age; but they are women at fourteen in
that country, and even earlier. She was a Negress as to colour,
but not a real Negress; for her hair, although short and very
wavy, was not woolly, and her nose was straight. Her mouth
was small, and her teeth beautiful. Her figure was perfect, her
limbs being very elegantly formed. When she first rose in the
morning, I attended her to the brow of a hill just without the
palisades, where with devout but mistaken piety she adored the
rising sun&mdash;at least it appeared to me that she did so. She then
went down to the river to bathe, and as soon as her hair was dry
she had it dressed. This office, after a short time, devolved
upon me, and I became very expert, having to rub her hair with
a sweet oil, and then roll it up in its natural curls with a quill,
so as to dispose them to the most fanciful advantage as to form.</p>

<p>After her toilet was complete, she went to feed her poultry,
and some antelopes and other beasts, and then she practised at
a mark with her bow and arrows and javelin till about ten o&rsquo;clock,
when she went to the king&rsquo;s hut, and they all sat down to eat
together. After the repast, which lasted some time, if she did
not repose with the king, she retired to her own hut, where she
usually refreshed herself till about four o&rsquo;clock, when she returned
to the king, or ranged the woods, or otherwise amused
herself during the rest of the evening. I will say for the old savage
that he did not confine his wives. Such was our general
course of life, and wherever she went I attended her. The attachment
I showed and really felt for her secured her confidence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
and she always treated me in a kind and familiar manner. Their
language consists of few words compared to our own, and in a
short time, by help of signs, we understood each other tolerably
well. She appeared to have a most ardent curiosity to know who
we were, and from whence we came, and all the time that we
passed alone was employed in putting questions, and my endeavouring
to find out her meaning and answer them. This, although
very difficult at first, I was eventually enabled to accomplish indifferently
well. She was most zealous in her mistaken religion,
and one morning when I was following her to her devotions on
the hill, she asked me where my God was? I pointed upwards,
upon which she told me with great joy and innocency, that hers
was there too, and that, therefore, they must be the same God,
or if not they must be friends. Convinced that she was right, she
made me worship with her, bowing my head down to the sand,
and going through the same forms, which of course I did not
understand the meaning of; but I prayed to my God, and therefore
made no objection, as it was pleasing to her. This apparent
conformity in religion recommended me more strongly to her,
and we became more intimate, and I was certainly attached to
her by every tie of gratitude. I was quite happy in the friendship
and kindness she showed towards me; the only drawback was
my fear of the proud old king, and the recollection of him often
made me check myself, and suddenly assume a more distant and
respectful demeanour towards her. I soon found out that she
dreaded the old savage as much as I did, and hated him even
more. In his presence she treated me very sternly, and ordered
me about in a very dictatorial manner; but when we were alone,
and had no fear of being seen, she would then be very familiar,
sometimes even locking her arm into mine, and laughing as she
pointed out the contrast of the colours, and in the full gaiety of
her young heart rejoicing that we were alone, and could converse
freely together. As she was very intelligent, she soon perceived
that I possessed much knowledge that she did not, and that she
could not comprehend what I wanted to teach her. This induced
her to look upon me with respect as well as kindness.</p>

<p>One day I purposely left her bow behind in the hut where my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
companions resided; and on her asking me for it, I told her that
I had done so, but that I would make my companions send it
without my going back. I tore off a piece of the bark of a tree,
and with the point of an arrow I wrote to one of them, desiring
him to send it by bearer; and calling a young Negro boy, told him
in her presence to give that piece of bark to the white man, and
come back again to the queen. Whyna, for such was the name
of my mistress queen, stood in suspense, waiting the result; in
a few minutes the boy returned, bringing the bow. Astonished
at this, she made me write again and again for her arrows, her
lance, and many other things. Finding by these being immediately
sent that we had a method of communicating with each
other at a distance, she earnestly insisted upon being taught so
surprising an art. Going at a distance from me, she ordered me
to talk to her when out of hearing, and finding that I could not,
or, as she seemed to suppose, that I would not, she became discontented
and out of humour. I could by no means make her
comprehend how it was performed, but I made her understand
that as soon as I was fully acquainted with her language, I should
be able to teach her. She was satisfied with this, but made me
promise that I would teach nobody else.</p>

<p>By the canoes in the river, I easily made her comprehend that
I came in a vast boat from a distant land, over a great expanse of
water, and also how it was that we fell into the Negroes&rsquo; power.
I then found out from her that the Negroes had pretended that we
had invaded their land to procure slaves, and that they had vanquished
us in battle; hence their songs of triumph on bringing
us to the king. I pointed out the heavenly bodies to her in the
evenings, trying to make her comprehend something of their nature
and motions, but in vain. This had, however, one good
effect; she looked up to me with more respect, hoping that some
day, when I could fully explain myself, she might be herself taught
all these wonders. With these feelings towards me, added to my
sedulous endeavours to please her, and obey her slightest wishes,
it is not surprising that she treated me as a companion, and not
as a slave, and gave me every innocent proof of her attachment.
More I never wished, and almost dreaded that our intimacy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
would be too great. Happy when alone with her, I ever returned
with reluctance to the presence of the old king, whose sight and
company I dreaded.</p>

<p>The boundless cruelty of this monster was a continual check
to all my happiness. Accustomed to blood from his childhood,
he appeared wholly insensible to human feelings, and derided the
agonies of the wretches who daily fell by his hands. One day he
amused himself by shooting small bird-arrows at a man who was
bound to a post before the tent, which was placed there for the
punishment of those who were his victims. He continued for
hours fixing the arrows in different parts of his body, mimicking
and deriding his cries. At last, contrary to his intentions, one
of the arrows hit the man in the throat, and his head drooped. As
the old savage saw that the poor man was dying, he drew another
arrow and sent it through his heart, very much annoyed at his
disappointment in not prolonging the poor creature&rsquo;s sufferings.
I was witness to this scene with silent horror, and many more of
a similar nature. I hardly need say, that I felt what my punishment
would be if I had by any means roused the jealousy of this
monster; and I knew that, without giving him real cause, a moment
of bare suspicion would be sufficient to sacrifice my mistress
as well as me.</p>

<div class="chaphead"><p>I attend the King on a hunting Expedition&mdash;Chase of wild Animals&mdash;Whyna
and I in great danger from a Tiger&mdash;Barbarity of the King
to my young Mistress&mdash;I try to soothe her&mdash;I and my Companions
are ransomed&mdash;Sad parting with Whyna&mdash;After an Encounter with a

<p>I had been about three months in captivity, when the old
king with his four wives and a large party of Negroes, left the
town, and went into the woods to hunt. My companions were
left in the town, but I was ordered to attend my mistress, and I
went with the hopes of being able by some means to make my
escape, for my fear of the old monarch was much greater than my
regard for my mistress. As I had not become a proficient with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
bows and arrows, or in hurling the javelin, I was equipped with
a strong spear. My mistress was skilful to admiration with the
arrow and javelin; she never missed her aim that I knew, and she
certainly never appeared to such advantage as she did at this
hunting-party. Her activity, her symmetry of limb, and her
courage, her skill with her weapons, all won the heart of the old
king; and I believe that his strong attachment to her arose more
from her possession of the above qualities than from any other
cause. Certain it is, that the old savage doted on her&mdash;she was
the only being who could bend his stubborn will. As his age
prevented him from joining in the chase, he always appeared to
part with her with regret, and to caution her not to run into useless
danger; and when we returned at night, the old man&rsquo;s
eyes sparkled with the rapture of dotage as he welcomed her
return.</p>

<p>The method of our chase was to beat the country, with a
number of men, in a vast circle, until we had gathered all the
game into one thicket; then the strongest warriors with their
large spears went in and drove out the game, which was killed by
the hunters who hovered about within the circle.</p>

<p>The animals which we had to encounter were large fierce
black pigs, leopards, jackals, tigers, mountain cats, and others
which I have no name for&mdash;and in spite of the ferocity of many
of these animals when they bounded out, they were met with such
a shower of javelins, or transfixed by the strong stabbing-spears
of the warriors, that few escaped, and they rarely did any mischief.
One day, however, the beaters having just entered a
thicket, Whyna, who was eager for the sport, and plied within
the circle with the other hunters, hearing a rustling in the jungle,
went to the verge of it, to be the first to strike the animal which
came out. As usual, I was close to her, when a large tiger
burst out, and she pierced him with her javelin, but not sufficient
to wound the animal so severely as to disable him. The tiger
turned, and I drove my spear into his throat. This checked him,
as it remained in, but in a spring which he gave the handle broke
short off, and although the iron went further in, our danger was
imminent. Whyna ran, and so did I, to escape from the beast&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
fury; for, although after I had wounded it with my spear, we
had both retreated, we were not so far, but that in two or three
bounds he would have been upon us. My mistress was as fleet
as the wind, and soon passed me, but as she passed me she
caught me by the hand, and dragged me along at a pace that with
difficulty I could keep my legs. The surrounding hunters
alarmed at her danger, and knowing what they had to expect from
the mercy of the old king if she was destroyed by the animal,
closed in between us and the tiger, and after a fierce combat, in
which some were killed and many wounded, they despatched
him with their spears. The head of the animal, which was of
unusual size, was cut off and carried home to the old king in
triumph; and when he heard of the danger that Whyna had been
in, he caressed her with tears, and I could not help saying that
the old wretch had some heart after all. Whyna told the king
that if I had not pierced the animal with my spear, and prevented
his taking his first spring, she should have lost her life, and the
monster grinned a ghastly smile at me, which I presume he
meant for either approbation or gratitude.</p>

<p>At other times the chase would be that of the multitude of
birds which were to be found in the woods. The bow and arrow
only were used, and all I had to do now was to pick up all my
mistress had killed, and return her arrows&mdash;she would constantly
kill on the wing with her arrow, which not many could do besides
her. By degrees I imbibed a strong passion for the sport, attended
as it was with considerable danger, and was never so
happy as when engaged in it. We remained about two months
in the woods, when the king was tired, and we returned to the
town, where I continued for some time to pass the same kind of
life as I had done before.</p>

<p>I should have been quite happy in my slavery from my affection
to my mistress, had not a fresh instance of the unbounded
cruelty of the old monarch occurred a few days after our return
from the chase, which filled us all with consternation and horror,
for we discovered that not even my mistress, Whyna, could always
prevail with the savage monster.</p>

<p>One morning I perceived that one of the king&rsquo;s guards, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
had always treated me with great kindness, and with whom I was
very intimate, was tied up to the executioner&rsquo;s post before the
hut. Aware of the fate which awaited him, I ran to the hut of
Whyna, and so great was my distress that I could not speak; all
I could do was to clasp her knees and repeat the man&rsquo;s name,
pointing to the post to which he was tied. She understood me,
and eager to save the man, or to oblige me, she ran to the large
hut, and attempted to intercede with the old barbarian for the
man&rsquo;s life; but he was in an agony of rage and passion; he refused
her, lifting up his sabre to despatch the man; Whyna was
rash enough to seize the king&rsquo;s arm, and prevent the blow, at
this his rage redoubled, his eyes glowed like live coals, and
turning to her with the look of a demon, he caught her by the
hair, and dragging her across his feet, lifted up his scimitar in
the act to strike off her head. I sickened with horror at the danger
she was in, but I thought he would not strike. I had no weapon,
but if he had done so, I would have revenged her death, even if
I had lost my life. At last the old monster let go her hair, spurning
her away with his foot, so that she rolled over on the sand,
and then turning to the unhappy man, with an upward slanting
blow of his sabre, he ripped him up from the flank to the chest,
so that his bowels fell down at his feet; he then looked round
at us all with an aspect which froze our blood, and turned
away sulkily to his hut, leaving us to recover our spirits how we
might.</p>

<p>Poor Whyna, terrified and enraged at the same time, as soon
as I had led her to her hut, and we were by ourselves, gave way
to the storm of passion which swelled her bosom, execrating her
husband with the utmost loathing and abhorrence, and lamenting
in the most passionate manner her having ever been connected
with him. Trembling alike at the danger to which I had exposed
her, and moved by her condition, I could not help mingling my
tears with hers, and endeavoured by caresses and condoling with
her to reduce her excitement. Had the old king seen me, I know
what both our fates would have been, but at that time I cared not.
I was very young, very impetuous, and I was resolved that I
would not permit either her or myself to die unavenged. At last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
she sobbed herself to sleep, and I took my usual station outside
of the hut. It was well that I did so, for not five minutes afterwards
the old wretch, having got over his temper, came out of
his tent and bent his steps towards the hut, that he might make
friends with her, for she was too necessary to his happiness.
He soon treated her with his accustomed kindness, but I perceived
that after the scene I have described, her aversion for him
was doubled.</p>

<p>There were some scores of women in the various huts within
the palisade, all of whom I understood were wives to the old
monarch, but none but the four we found with him when we were
first brought into his presence were ever to be seen in his company.
I had, by means of my kind mistress, the opportunity of
constantly supplying my companions with fowls and venison,
which was left from the king&rsquo;s table, and through her care, they
always met with kind and gentle usage.</p>

<p>For another two months did I thus remain happy in the company
of Whyna, and miserable when in the presence of the king,
whose eye it was impossible to meet without quailing; when one
morning we were all ordered out, and were surrounded by a large
party armed with spears, javelins, and bird-arrows&mdash;I say
bird-arrows, as those that they use in war are much larger. We soon
discovered that we were to be sent to some other place, but where
or why, we could not find out. Shortly afterwards the crowd
opened, and Whyna made her appearance. She took the feather
circle off my head, and the manacles off my wrist and leg, and
went and laid them at the king&rsquo;s feet. She then returned, and
told me that I was free as well as my companions, but that I only,
if I chose, had permission to remain with her.</p>

<p>I did not at first reply. She then, in the most earnest manner,
begged me to remain with her as her slave; and as she did
not dare to say what she felt, or use caresses to prevail upon me,
she stamped her little feet with eagerness and impatience. The
struggle in my own heart was excessive. I presumed that we were
about to be made a present to some other king, and I felt that I
never could expect so easy and so pleasant a servitude as I then
enjoyed. I was sincerely attached, and indeed latterly, I was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
more than attached, to Whyna; I felt that it was dangerous.
Had the old king been dead, I would have been content to pass
my life with her; and I was still hesitating, notwithstanding the
remonstrances of my companions, when the crowd opened a little,
and I beheld the old king looking at me, and I felt convinced that
his jealousy was at last aroused, and that if I consented to remain,
my life would not be worth a day&rsquo;s purchase.</p>

<p>Whyna also turned, and met the look of the old king. Whether
she read in his countenance what I did, I know not; but this
is certain, she made no more attempts to persuade me, but
waving her hand for us to set off on our journey, she slowly retired,
and when arrived at the hut turned round towards us. We
all prostrated ourselves before her, and then set off on our
journey. She retired to the door of her own hut, and two or three
times waved her hand to us, at which our guards made us every
time again prostrate ourselves. She then walked out to the little
hill where she always went up to pray, and for the last time waved
her hand, and then I perceived her sink down on the ground,
and turn her head in the direction which she always did when she
prayed.</p>

<p>We now proceeded on our journey in a north-west direction,
our guards treating us with the greatest kindness. We rested
every day from ten till four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and then
walked till late at night. Corn was supplied us from the scattered
hamlets as we passed along, and our escort procured us flesh and
fowl with their bows and arrows; but we were in a state of great
anxiety to know where we were going, and nobody appeared able
or willing to tell us. I often thought of Whyna, and at times
repented that I had not remained with her, as I feared falling into
a worse slavery, but the recollection of the old king&rsquo;s diabolical
parting look was sufficient to make me think that it was best as it
was. Now that I had left my mistress, I thought of her kindness
and amiable qualities, and her affection for me; and although it
may appear strange that I should feel myself in love with a black
woman, I will not deny but that I was so. I could not help being
so, and that is all the excuse I can offer.</p>

<p>Our guards now informed us that we were about to pass for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
few miles through the territory of another king, and that they
were not sure what our reception might be; but this was soon
made evident, for we observed a party behind us, which moved
as we moved, although they did not attack us; and soon afterwards
a larger body in front were blocking up our passage, and
we found that we were beset. The commander of our party,
therefore, gave orders for battle, and he put into our hands strong
spears, they being the only weapons we could use, and entreated
us to fight. Our party was greatly outnumbered by the enemy,
but ours were chosen warriors. As for us white men, we kept
together, agreeing among ourselves, that we would defend ourselves
if attacked, but would not offend either party by taking an
unnecessary part in the fray, as it was immaterial to us to whom
we belonged.</p>

<p>The battle, or rather skirmish, soon began. They dispersed,
and shot their arrows from behind the trees, and this warfare
continued some time without damage to either party, till at last
they attacked us closely; then, our commander killing that of
the enemy, they gave way just as another party was coming
forward to attack us white men; but finding us resolute in our
defence, and our own warriors coming to our assistance, the
rout was general. They could not, however, prevent some prisoners
from being taken; most of them wounded with the bird-arrows,
which, having their barbs twisted in the form of an S,
gave great pain in their extraction. I observed that a particular
herb chewed, and bound up with the bleeding wound, was their
only remedy, and that when the bone was injured, they considered
the wound mortal.</p>

<p>We now turned to the eastward to get back into our own territory;
we left the prisoners and wounded at a village, and receiving
a reinforcement, we took a circuit to avoid this hostile
people, and continued our route. On the eighth morning, just
as we were stopping to repose, one of the warriors, who had
mounted a hill before us, shouted and waved his hand. We ran
up to him, and as soon as we gained the summit, were transported
with the sight of the British flag flying on Senegal fort,
on the other side of the river. We now understood that by some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
means or another we had been ransomed, and so it proved to be;
for the governor hearing that we were prisoners up the country,
had sent messengers offering the old king a handsome present for
our liberation. I afterwards found out that the price paid in
goods amounted to about fifty-six shillings a-head. The governor
received us kindly, clothed us, and sent us down to the ship,
which was with a full cargo in the road, and intending to sail the
next day, and we were received and welcomed by our messmates
as men risen from the dead.</p>

<p>We sailed two days afterwards, and had a fortunate voyage
home to Liverpool.</p>

<p>As the captain reported me to be a very attentive and good
officer, although I was then but twenty-three years of age, and
as I had been previously on good terms and useful to the owner,
I was kindly received by him, and paid much more attention to,
than my situation on board might warrant. My captivity among
the Negroes, and the narrative I gave of my adventures, were
also a source of much interest. I was at first questioned by the
gentlemen of Liverpool, and afterwards one of the merchant&rsquo;s
ladies, who had heard something of my adventures, and found
out that I was a young and personable man, with better manners
than are usually to be found before the mast, invited me one
evening to a tea-party, that I might amuse her friends with my
adventures. They were most curious about the Negro queen,
Whyna, inquiring into every particular as to her personal appearance
and dress, and trying to find out, as women always do,
if there was any thing of an intrigue between us. They shook
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
their little fingers at me, when I solemnly declared that there was
not, and one or two of them cajoled me aside to obtain my acknowledgment
of what they really believed to be the truth, although
I would not confess it.</p>

<p>When they had tired themselves with asking questions about
the Negro queen, they then began to ask about myself, and how
it happened I was not such a bear, and coarse in my manners and
address, as the other seamen. To this I could give no other
reply but that I had been educated when a child. They would
fain know who were my father and mother, and in what station of
life it had pleased God to place them; but I hardly need say, my
dear Madam, to you who are so well acquainted with my birth
and parentage, that I would not disgrace my family by acknowledging
that one of their sons was in a situation so unworthy; not
that I thought at that time, nor do I think now, that I was so
much to blame in preferring independence in a humble position,
to the life that induced me to take the step which I did; but as I
could not state who my family were without also stating why I had
quitted them, I preserved silence, as I did not think that I had
any right to communicate family secrets to strangers. The consequences
of my first introduction to genteel society were very
agreeable; I received many more invitations from the company
assembled, notwithstanding that my sailor&rsquo;s attire but ill corresponded
with the powdered wigs and silk waistcoats of the gentlemen,
or the hoops and furbelows of satin which set off the
charms of the ladies.</p>

<p>At first I did not care so much, but as I grew more at my ease,
I felt ashamed of my dress, and the more so as the young foplings
would put their glasses to their eyes, and look at me as if I were
a monster. But supported as I was by the fair sex, I cared little
for them. The ladies vowed that I was charming, and paid me
much courtesy; indeed my vanity more than once made me suspect
that I was something more than a mere favourite with one
or two of them, one especially, a buxom young person, and very
coquettish, who told me, as we were looking out of the bay window
of the withdrawing-room, that since I could be so secret
with respect to what took place between the Negress queen and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
myself, I must be sure to command the good-will and favour of
the ladies, who always admired discretion in so young and so
handsome a man. But I was not to be seduced by this flattery,
for somehow or another I had ever before me the French lady,
and her conduct to me; and I had almost a dislike, or I should
rather say, I had imbibed an indifference for the sex.</p>

<p>This admission into good society did, however, have one
effect upon me; it made me more particular in my dress, and all
my wages were employed in the decoration of my person. At that
time you may recollect, Madam, there were but two styles of
dress among the seamen; one was that worn by those who sailed
in the northern seas, and the other by those who navigated in
the tropical countries, both suitable to the climates. The first
was the jacket, woollen frock, breeches, and petticoat of canvas
over all, with worsted stockings, shoes, and buckles, and
usually a cap of skin upon the head; the other a light short
jacket, with hanging buttons, red sash, trowsers, and neat
shoes and buckles, with a small embroidered cap with falling
crown, or a hat and feather. It was this last which I had always
worn, having been continually in warm climates, and my hair
was dressed in its natural ringlets instead of a wig, which I was
never partial to, although very common among seamen; my ears
were pierced, and I wore long gold earrings, as well as gilt
buckles in my shoes; and, by degrees, I not only improved
my dress so as to make it very handsome in materials, but my
manners were also very much altered for the better.</p>

<p>I had been at Liverpool about two months, waiting for the
ship to unload and take in cargo for another voyage, when a
privateer belonging to the same owner, came into port with four
prizes of considerable value; and the day afterwards I was invited
by the owner to meet the captain who commanded the privateer.</p>

<p>He was a very different looking person from Captain Weatherall,
who was a stout, strong-limbed man, with a weather-beaten
countenance. He, on the contrary, was a young man of
about twenty-six, very slight in person, with a dark complexion,
hair and eyes jet black. I should have called him a very handsome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
Jew&mdash;for he bore that cast of countenance, and I afterwards
discovered that he was of that origin, although I cannot
say that he ever followed the observances of that remarkable
people. He was handsomely dressed, wearing his hair slightly
powdered, a laced coat and waistcoat, blue sash and trowsers,
with silver-mounted pistols and dagger in his belt, and a smart
hanger by his side. He had several diamond rings on his finger,
and carried a small clouded cane. Altogether, I had never fallen
in with so smart and prepossessing a personage, and should have
taken him for one of the gentlemen commending the king&rsquo;s ships,
rather than the captain of a Liverpool privateer. He talked well
and fluently, and with an air of command and decision, taking
the lead in the company, although it might have been considered
that he was not by any means the principal person in it. The
owner, during the evening, informed me that he was a first-rate
officer, of great personal courage, and that he had made a great
deal of money, which he had squandered away almost as fast as
he received it.</p>

<p>With this person, whose name was Captain Levee (an alteration,
I suspect, from Levi), I was much pleased; and as I
found that he did not appear to despise my acquaintance, I took
much pains to please him, and we were becoming very intimate,
when my ship was ready to sail. I now found that I was promoted
to the office of first mate, which gave me great satisfaction.</p>

<p>We sailed with an assorted cargo, but very light, and nothing
of consequence occurred during our passage out. We made good
traffic on the coast as we ran down it, receiving ivory, gold-dust,
and wax, in exchange for our printed cottons and hardware. After
being six weeks on the coast, we put into Senegal to dispose
of the remainder of our cargo; which we soon did to the
governor, who gave us a fair exchange, although by no means so
profitable a barter as what we had made on the coast; but that we
did not expect for what might be called the refuse of our cargo.
The captain was much pleased, as he knew the owner would be
satisfied with him, and, moreover, he had himself a venture in
the cargo; and we had just received the remainder of the ivory
from the governor&rsquo;s stores, and had only to get on board a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
sufficiency of provisions and water for our homeward voyage, when a
circumstance took place which I must now relate.</p>

<p>Our crew consisted of the captain, and myself, as first mate,
the second mate, and twelve seamen, four of which were those
who had been taken prisoners with me, and had been released,
as I have related, in our previous voyage. These four men were
very much attached to me, I believe chiefly from my kindness to
them when I was a slave to the queen Whyna, as I always procured
for them every thing which I could, and, through the exertions
of my mistress, had them plentifully supplied with provisions
from the king&rsquo;s table. The second mate and other eight
men we had shipped at Liverpool. They were fine, stout fellows,
but appeared to be loose characters, but that we did not discover
till after we had sailed. There was anchored with us at Senegal a
low black brig, employed in the slave-trade, which had made
the bay at the same time that we did; and to their great surprise&mdash;for
she was considered a very fast sailer&mdash;she was
beaten at all points by our ship, which was considered the fastest
vessel out of Liverpool. The crew of the slaver were numerous,
and as bloodthirsty a set of looking fellows as ever I fell in with.
Their boat was continually alongside of our vessel, and I perceived
that their visits were made to the eight men whom we had
shipped at Liverpool, and that they did not appear inclined to be
at all intimate with the rest of the crew. This roused my suspicions,
although I said nothing; but I watched them very closely.
One forenoon, as I was standing at the foot of the companion-ladder,
concealed by the booby-hatch from the sight of those on
deck, I heard our men talking over the side, and at last, as I remained
concealed, that I might overhear the conversation, one of
the slaver&rsquo;s men from the boat said, &ldquo;To-night, at eight o&rsquo;clock,
we will come to arrange the whole business.&rdquo; The boat then
shoved off, and pulled for the brig.</p>

<p>Now, it was the custom of the captain to go onshore every
evening to drink sangaree and smoke with the governor, and very
often I went with him, leaving the ship in charge of the second
mate. It had been my intention, and I had stated as much to the
second mate, to go this evening, as it was the last but one that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
we should remain at Senegal; but from what I overheard I made
up my mind that I would not go. About an hour before sunset, I
complained of headache and sickness, and sat down under the
awning over the after part of the quarter-deck. When the captain
came up to go on shore, he asked me if I was ready, but I made
no answer, only put my hand to my head.</p>

<p>The captain, supposing that I was about to be attacked by the
fever of the country, was much concerned, and desired the second
mate to help him to take me down to the state-room, and
then went on shore; the boat was, as usual, pulled by the four
men who were prisoners with me, and whom the captain found
he could trust on shore better than the others belonging to the
crew, who would indulge in liquor whenever they had an opportunity.
I remained in my bed-place till it was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock,
and then crept softly up the companion-hatch to ascertain who
was on deck.</p>

<p>The men were all below in the fore-peak at their suppers, and
as I had before observed that their conferences were held on the
forecastle, I went forward, and covered myself up with a part of
the main-topsail, which the men had been repairing during the
day. From this position I could hear all that passed, whether
they went down into the fore-peak, or remained to converse on the
forecastle. About ten minutes afterwards I heard the boat grate
against the ship&rsquo;s side, and the men of the slaver mount on
the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right?&rdquo; inquired one of the slavers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied our second mate; &ldquo;skipper and his men are
on shore, and the first mate taken with the fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; replied another; &ldquo;one less to handle.
And now, my lads, let&rsquo;s to business, and have every thing settled
to-night, so that we may not be seen together any more till
the work is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They then commenced a consultation, by which I found it was
arranged that our ship was to be boarded and taken possession of
as soon as she was a few miles out of the bay, for they dared not
attack us while we were at anchor close to the fort; but the second
mate and eight men belonging to us were to pretend to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
resistance until beaten down below, and when the vessel was in
their power, the captain, I, and the other four men who were
ashore in the boat, were to be silenced for ever. After which
there came on a discussion as to what was to be done with the
cargo, which was very valuable, and how the money was to be
shared out when the cargo was sold. Then they settled who were
to be officers on board of the ship, which there is no doubt they
intended to make a pirate vessel. I also discovered that, if they
succeeded, it was their intention to kill their own captain and
such men of the slaver who would not join them, and scuttle their
own vessel, which was a very old one.</p>

<p>The consultation ended by a solemn and most villainous oath
being administered to every man as to secrecy and fidelity, after
which the men of the slaver went into their boat, and pulled to
their own vessel. The second mate and our men remained on
deck about a quarter of an hour, and then all descended by the
ladder to the fore-peak, and turned into their hammocks.</p>

<p>As soon as I thought I could do so with safety, I came out of
my lurking-place, and retreated to the state-room. It was fortunate
that I did, for a minute afterwards I heard a man on deck,
and the second mate came down the companion-hatch, and inquired
whether I wanted any thing. I told him no; that I was
very ill, and only hoped to be able to go to sleep, and asked him
if the captain had returned. He replied that he had not, and
then went away. As soon as I was left to myself, I began to consider
what would be best to be done. I knew the captain to be a
very timorous man, and I was afraid to trust him with the secret,
as I thought he would be certain to let the men know by his conduct
that they were discovered, and their plans known. The four
men who were prisoners with me I knew that I could confide in.
This was the Tuesday night, and we proposed sailing on the
Thursday. Now we had no means of defence on board, except
one small gun, which was honeycombed and nearly useless. It
did very well to make a signal with, but had it been loaded with
ball, I believe it would have burst immediately. It is true that
we had muskets and cutlasses, but what use would they have
been against such a force as would be opposed, and two-thirds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
of our men mutineers. Of course we must have been immediately
overpowered.</p>

<p>That the slavers intended to take possession of their own
vessel before they took ours, I had no doubt. It is true that we
outsailed them when we had a breeze, but the bay was usually
becalmed, and it was not till a vessel had got well into the offing
that she obtained a breeze, and there was no doubt but that they
would take the opportunity of boarding us when we were moving
slowly through the water, and a boat might easily come up with
us. The slaver had stated his intention of sailing immediately
to procure her cargo elsewhere, and if she got under weigh at the
same time that we did, no suspicion would be created. To apply
for protection to the governor would be useless&mdash;he could not
protect us after we were clear of the bay. Indeed, if it were
known that we had so done, it would probably only precipitate
the affair, and we should be taken possession of while at anchor,
for the shot from the fort would hardly reach us. It was, therefore,
only by stratagem that we could escape from the clutches of
these miscreants. Again, allowing that we were to get clear of
the slavers, we were still in an awkward position, for, supposing
the captain to be of any use, we should still only be six men
against nine, and we might be overpowered by our own crew,
who were determined and powerful men.</p>

<p>All night I lay on my bed reflecting upon what ought to be
done, and at last I made up my mind.</p>

<p>The next morning I went on deck, complaining very much,
but stating that the fever had left me. The long-boat was sent
on shore for more water, and I took care that the second mate and
eight men should be those selected for the service. As soon as
they had shoved off, I called the other four men on the forecastle,
and told them what I had overheard. They were very much
astonished, for they had had no idea that there was any thing of
the kind going forward. I imparted to them all my plans, and
they agreed to support me in every thing&mdash;indeed, they were all
brave men, and would have, if I had acceded to it, attempted to
master and overpower the second mate and the others, and make
sail in the night; but this I would not permit, as there was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
great risk. They perfectly agreed with me that it was no use
acquainting the captain, and that all we had to do was to get rid
of these men, and carry the vessel home how we could. How
that was to be done was the point at issue. One thing was certain,
that it was necessary to leave the bay that night, or it would
be too late. Fortunately, there was always a light breeze during
the night, and the nights were dark, for there was no moon till
three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, by which time we could have gained
the offing, and then we might laugh at the slaver, as we were
lighter in our heels. The boat came off with the water about
noon, and the men went to dinner. The captain had agreed to
dine with the governor, and I had been asked to accompany him.
It was to be our farewell dinner, as we were to sail the next
morning. I had been cogitating a long while to find out how to
get rid of these fellows, when at last I determined that I would
go on shore with the captain, and propose a plan to the governor.
His knowledge of what was about to be attempted could do no
harm, and I thought he would help us; so I went into the boat,
and when we landed I told the men what I intended to do. As
soon as I arrived at the governor&rsquo;s, I took an opportunity, while
the captain was reading a book, to request a few moments&rsquo; conversation,
and I then informed the governor of the conspiracy
which was afloat, and when I had so done, I pointed out to him
the propriety of saying nothing to the captain until all was safe,
and proposed my plan to him, which he immediately acceded to.
When he returned to where the captain was still reading, he told
him that he had a quantity of gold-dust and other valuables,
which he wished to send to England by his ship; but that he did
not wish to do it openly, as it was supposed that he did not traffic,
and that if the captain would send his long-boat on shore after
dark, he would send all the articles on board, with instructions
to whom they were to be consigned on our arrival. The captain
of course consented. We bade the governor farewell about half
an hour before dark, and returned on board. After I had been
a few minutes on deck, I sent for the second mate, and told him
as a secret what the governor had proposed to do, and that he
would be required to land after dark for the goods, telling him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
that there was a very large quantity of gold-dust, and that he must
be very careful. I knew that this intelligence would please him,
as it would add to their plunder when they seized the vessel; and
I told him that as we sailed at daylight, he must lose no time, but
be on board again as soon as he could, that we might hoist in the
long-boat. About eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the boat, with
him and the eight men, went on shore. The governor had promised
to detain them, and ply them with liquor, till we had time
to get safe off. As soon as they were out of sight and hearing,
we prepared every thing for getting under weigh. The captain
had gone to his cabin, but was not in bed. I went down to him,
and told him I should remain up till the boat returned, and see
that all was right; and that in the mean time I would get every
thing ready for weighing the next morning, and that he might just
as well go to bed now, and I would call him to relieve me at daylight.
To this arrangement he consented; and in half an hour
I perceived that his candle was out, and that he had retired.
Being now so dark that we could not perceive the slaver, which
lay about three cables&rsquo; length from us, it was fairly to be argued
that she could not see us; I therefore went forward and slipped
the cable without noise, and sent men up aloft to loose the sails.
There was a light breeze, sufficient to carry us about two knots
through the water, and we knew that it would rather increase
than diminish. In half an hour, weak-handed as we were, we
were under sail, every thing being done without a word being
spoken, and with the utmost precaution. You may imagine how
rejoiced we all were when we found that we had man&oelig;uvred so
well; notwithstanding, we kept a sharp look-out, to see if the
slaver had perceived our motions, and had followed us; and the
fear of such being the case kept us under alarm till near daylight,
when the breeze blew strong, and we felt that we had nothing
more to dread. As the day broke, we found that we were
four or five leagues from the anchorage, and could not see the
lower masts of the slaver, which still remained where we had
left her.</p>

<p>Satisfied that we were secure, I then went down to the captain,
and, as he lay in bed, made him acquainted with all that had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
passed. He appeared as if awakened from a dream, rose without
making any reply, and hastened on deck. When he found out
that we were under weigh, and so far from the land, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must all be true; but how shall we be able to take the
ship home with so few hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied, that I had no fears on that score, and that I would
answer for bringing the vessel safe to Liverpool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;how is it that I was not informed of
all this? I might have made some arrangements with the men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but if you had attempted to do so,
the vessel would have been taken immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why was I not acquainted with it, I want to know?&rdquo; he
said again.</p>

<p>I had by this time made up my mind to the answer I should
give him; so I said: &ldquo;Because it would have placed a serious
responsibility on your shoulders if, as captain of this vessel, you
had sailed to England with such a valuable cargo and so few
hands. The governor and I, therefore, thought it better that
you should not be placed in such an awkward position, and therefore
we considered it right not to say a word to you about it. Now,
if any thing goes wrong, it will be my fault, and not yours, and
the owner cannot blame you.&rdquo; When I had said this, the captain
was silent for a minute or two, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe it is all for the best, and I thank you and
the governor too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having got over this little difficulty, I did not care. We
made all sail, and steered homewards, and, after a rapid passage,
during which we were on deck day and night, we arrived,
very much fatigued, at Liverpool. Of course the captain communicated
what had occurred to the owner, who immediately sent
for me, and having heard my version of the story, expressed his
acknowledgment for the preservation of the vessel; and to prove
his sincerity, he presented me with fifty guineas for myself, and
ten for each of the men. The cargo was soon landed, and I was
again at liberty. I found Captain Levee in port; he had just
returned from another cruise, and had taken a rich prize. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
met me with the same cordiality as before; and having asked me
for a recital of what had occurred at Senegal, of which he had
heard something from the owner, as soon as I had finished, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a lad after my own heart, and I wish we were sailing
together. I want a first-lieutenant like you, and if you will go
with me, say the word, and it will be hard but I will have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied that I was not very anxious to be in a privateer again;
and this brought on a discourse upon what occurred when I was in
the Revenge with Captain Weatherall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;all this makes me more anxious to
have you. I like fair fighting, and hate buccaneering like yourself;
however, we will talk of it another time. I am about to
start for London. What do you say, will you join me, and we
will have some sport? With plenty of money, you may do any
thing in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I have not plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That shall make no difference; money is of no use but to
spend it, that I know of,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee. &ldquo;I have plenty
for both of us, and my purse is at your service; help yourself as
you please, without counting, for I shall be your enemy if you
offer to return it. That&rsquo;s settled; the horses are all ready, and
we will start on Wednesday. How will you dress? I think it
might be better to alter your costume, now you are going to London.
You&rsquo;ll make a pretty fellow, dress how you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I give you an answer to all your kind proposals, I
must speak to the owner, Captain Levee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you must; shall we go there now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; I replied. And we accordingly set off.</p>

<p>Captain Levee introduced the subject as soon as we arrived at
the counting-house, stating that he wanted me to be first-lieutenant
of the privateer, and that I was going to London with him,
if he had no objection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for going to London with you for five or six weeks, Captain
Levee, there can be no objection to that,&rdquo; replied the owner;
&ldquo;but as for being your first-lieutenant, that is another question.
I have a vessel now fitting out, and intended to offer the command
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
of it to Mr. Elrington. I do so now at once, and he must decide
whether he prefers being under your orders to commanding a
vessel of his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will decide that for him,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee. &ldquo;He
must command his own vessel; it would be no friendship on my
part to stand in the way of his advancement. I only hope, if she
is a privateer, that we may cruise together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot reply to that latter question,&rdquo; replied the owner.
&ldquo;Her destination is uncertain; but the command of her is now
offered to Mr. Elrington, if he will accept of it, before his trip to
the metropolis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied that I should with pleasure, and returned the owner
many thanks for his kindness; and, after a few minutes&rsquo; more
conversation, we look our leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I should advise you,&rdquo; said Captain Levee, as we
walked towards his lodgings, &ldquo;to dress as a captain of a vessel
of war, much in the style that I do. You are a captain, and
have a right so to do. Come with me, and let me fit you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I agreed with Captain Levee that I could not do better; so we
went and ordered my suits of clothes, and purchased the other
articles which I required. Captain Levee would have paid for
them, but I had money sufficient, and would not permit him;
indeed with my pay and present of fifty guineas I had upwards of
seventy guineas in my purse, and did not disburse more than fifty
in my accoutrements, although my pistols and hanger were very
handsome.</p>

<p>We did not start until three days after the time proposed,
when I found at daylight two stout well-bred horses at the door;
one for Captain Levee, and the other for me. We were attended
by two serving-men belonging to the crew of the privateer commanded
by Captain Levee&mdash;powerful, fierce-looking, and determined
men, armed to the teeth, and mounted upon strong
jades. One carried the valise of Captain Levee, which was heavy
with gold. The other had charge of mine, which was much
lighter, as you may suppose. We travelled for three days without
any interruption, making about thirty miles a-day, and stopping
at the hostelries to sleep every night. On the fourth day we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
had a slight affair, for as we were mounting a hill towards the
evening, we found our passage barred by five fellows with crape
masks, who told us to stand and deliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee, firing his pistol, and
reining up his horse at the same time. The ball struck the man,
who fell back on the crupper, while the others rushed forward.
My pistols were all ready, and I fired at the one who spurred his
horse upon me, but the horse rearing up saved his master, the
ball passing through the head of the animal, who fell dead,
holding his rider a prisoner by the thigh, which was underneath
his body. Our two men had come forward and ranged alongside
of us at the first attack, but now that two had fallen, the others
finding themselves in a minority, after exchanging shots, turned
their horses&rsquo; heads and galloped away. We would have pursued
them, but Captain Levee said it was better not, as there might
be more of the gang near, and by pursuing them we might separate
and be cut off in detail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with these fellows?&rdquo; asked our men of
Captain Levee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave them to get off how they can,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee.
&ldquo;I will not be stopped on my journey by such a matter as this. I
dare say they don&rsquo;t deserve hanging more than half the people we
meet. Let us push on and get into quarters for the night. After
all, Mr. Elrington,&rdquo; said Captain Levee to me, as we were setting
off, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a little land privateering, and we must not
be too hard upon them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I confess, Madam, when I recalled all that I had witnessed
on board of the Revenge, that I agreed with Captain Levee, that
these highwaymen were not worse than ourselves.</p>

<p>No other adventure occurred during our journey, and when
we arrived in London we directed our horses&rsquo; steps to a fashionable
tavern in St. Paul&rsquo;s, and took possession of apartments,
and as Captain Levee was well known, we were cordially greeted
and well attended. The tavern was in great repute, and resorted
to by all the wits and gay men of the day, and I soon found myself
on intimate terms with a numerous set of dashing blades, full of
life and jollity, and spending their money like princes; but it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
was a life of sad intemperance, and my head ached every morning
from the excess of the night before, and in our excursions in
the evenings we were continually in broils and disturbances, and
many a broken head, nay, sometimes a severe wound, was given
and received. After the first fortnight, I felt weary of this continual
dissipation, and as I was dressing a sword-cut which Captain
Levee had received in an affray, I one morning told him so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that it is all very foolish
and discreditable, but if we live with the gay and pretty fellows,
we must do as they do. Besides, how could I get rid of my
money, which burns in my pocket, if I did not spend as much
in one day as would suffice for three weeks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still I would rather dress a wound gained in an honourable
contest with the enemy than one received in a night brawl, and I
would rather see you commanding your men in action than reeling
with other drunkards in search of a quarrel in the streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel that it is beneath me, and I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;s beneath
you. You are a Mentor without a beard,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee.
&ldquo;But still it requires no beard to discover that I have made an ass
of myself. Now, what do you say, shall we take lodgings and
live more reputably, for while in this tavern we never shall be
able to do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should prefer it, to tell you the honest truth,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;for I have no pleasure in our present life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so, then,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I will tell them that I take
lodgings, that I may be near to a fair lady. That will be a good
and sufficient excuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day we secured lodgings to our satisfaction, and removed
into them, leaving our horses and men at the tavern.
We boarded with the family, and as there were others who did
the same, we had a very pleasant society, especially as there
were many of the other sex among the boarders. The first day
that we sat down to dinner, I found myself by the side of a young
man of pleasing manners, although with much of the coxcomb in
his apparel. His dress was very gay and very expensive, and he
wore a diamond-hilted sword and diamond buckles&mdash;at least so
they appeared to me, as I was not sufficient connoisseur to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
distinguish the brilliant from the paste. He was very affable and
talkative, and before dinner was over gave me the history of
many of the people present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the dame in the blue stomacher?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the prettiest of the two, I suppose,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;that one with the patches under the eye? She is a widow, having
just buried an old man of sixty, to whom she was sacrificed by
her mother. But although the old fellow was as rich as a Jew,
he found such fault with the lady&rsquo;s conduct that he left all his
money away from her. This is not generally known, and she
takes care to conceal it, for she is anxious to make another match,
and she will succeed if her funds, which are not <em>very</em> great,
enable her to carry on the game a little longer. I was nearly taken
in myself, but an intimacy with her cousin, who hates her, gave
me a knowledge of the truth. She still keeps her carriage, and
appears to be rolling in wealth, but she has sold her diamonds
and wears paste. And that plain young person on the other side
of her has money, and knows the value of it. She requires rent-roll
for rent-roll, and instead of referring you to her father and
mother, the little minx refers you to her lawyer and man of business.
Ugly as she is, I would have sacrificed myself, but she treated
me in that way, and upon my soul I was not very sorry for it, for
she is dear at any price, and I have since rejoiced at my want of
success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that elderly gentleman with such snow-white hair?&rdquo;
I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied my companion, &ldquo;nobody exactly knows,
but I have my idea. I think,&rdquo; said he, lowering his voice to a
whisper, &ldquo;that he is a Catholic priest, or a Jesuit, perhaps,
and a partisan of the house of Stuart. I have my reasons for supposing
so, and this I am sure of, which is, that he is closely
watched by the emissaries of government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may remember, Madam, how at that time the country
was disturbed by the landing of the Pretender in the summer of
the year before, and the great successes which he had met with,
and that the Duke of Cumberland had returned from the army in
the Low Countries, and had marched to Scotland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
&ldquo;Has there been any intelligence from Scotland relative to
the movements of the armies?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have heard that the Pretender had abandoned the siege
of Fort William, but nothing more; and how far the report is
true, it is hard to say. You military men must naturally have a
war one way or the other,&rdquo; said my companion, in a careless
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the fighting part of the question,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I
should feel it a matter of great indifference which side I fought
for, as the claim of both parties is a matter of mere opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and what may be your opinion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have none. I think the claims of both parties equal. The
house of Stuart lost the throne of England on account of its religion&mdash;that
of Hanover has been called to the throne for the same
cause. The adherents of both are numerous at the present moment;
and it does not follow because the house of Hanover has
the strongest party, that the house of Stuart should not uphold
its cause while there is a chance of success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true; but if you were to be obliged to take one side
or the other, which would it be by preference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I would support the Protestant religion in preference
to the Catholic. I am a Protestant, and that is reason
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; replied my companion. &ldquo;Is your brave
friend of the same opinion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really never put the question to him, but I think I may
safely answer that he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was fortunate, Madam, that I replied as I did, for I afterwards
discovered that this precious gossiping young man, with
his rings and ribbons, was no other than a government spy, on
the look-out for malcontents. Certainly his disguise was good,
for I never should have imagined it from his foppish exterior and
mincing manners.</p>

<p>We passed our time much more to my satisfaction now than
we did before, escorting the ladies to the theatre and to Ranelagh,
and the freedom with which Captain Levee (and I may say
I also) spent his money, soon gave us a passport to good society.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
About a fortnight afterwards, the news arrived of the battle of
Culloden, and great rejoicings were made. My foppish friend
remarked to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now that the hopes of the Pretender are blasted, and
the Hanoverian succession secured, there are plenty who pretend
to rejoice, and be excessively loyal, who, if the truth were
known, ought to be quartered as traitors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I must observe, that the day before the news of the
battle, the old gentleman with snow-white hair was arrested and
sent to the Tower, and he afterwards suffered for high treason.</p>

<p>But letters from the owner, saying that the presence of both
of us was immediately required, broke off this pleasant London
party. Indeed, the bag of gold was running very low, and this,
combined with the owner&rsquo;s letter, occasioned our breaking up
three days afterwards. We took leave of the company at the
lodgings, and there was a tender parting with one or two buxom
young women; after which we again mounted our steeds and set
off for Liverpool, where we arrived without any adventure worthy
of narration.</p>

<p>On our arrival, Captain Levee and I, as soon as we had got
rid of the dust of travel, called upon the owner, who informed
us that all the alterations in Captain Levee&rsquo;s vessel, which was a
large lugger of fourteen guns, and a hundred and twenty men,
were complete, and that my vessel was also ready for me, and
manned; but that I had better go on board and see if any thing
else was required, or if there was any alteration that I would
propose. Captain Levee and I immediately went down to the
wharf, alongside of which my vessel lay, that we might examine
her now that she was fitted out as a vessel of war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
She had been a schooner in the Spanish trade, and had been
captured by Captain Levee, who had taken her out from under a
battery as she lay at anchor, having just made her port from a
voyage from South America, being at that time laden with copper
and cochineal&mdash;a most valuable prize she had proved&mdash;and as
she was found to be a surprising fast sailer, the owner had
resolved to fit her out as a privateer.</p>

<p>She was not a large vessel, being of about a hundred and
sixty tons, but she was very beautifully built. She was now
armed with eight brass guns, of a calibre of six pounds each,
four howitzers aft, and two cohorns on the taffrail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a very sweet little craft here, Elrington,&rdquo; said
Captain Levee, after he had walked all over her, and examined
her below and aloft. &ldquo;She will sail better than before, I should
think, for she then had a very full cargo, and now her top hamper
is a mere nothing. Did the owner say how many men you
had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty-four is, I believe, to be our full complement,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;and I should think quite enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if they are good men and true. You may do a great
deal with this vessel, for you see she draws so little water, that
you may run in where I dare not venture. Come, we will now
return to our lodgings, pack up, and each go on board of our
vessels. We have had play enough, now to work again, and in
good earnest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to propose it myself,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;for with a
new vessel, officers and men not known to me, the sooner I am
on board and with them the better. It will take some time to get
every thing and everybody in their places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a man who understands his business,&rdquo; replied
Captain Levee. &ldquo;I wonder whether we shall be sent out together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only say, that I hope so,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as I should
profit much by your experience, and hope to prove to you that, if
necessary, I shall not be a bad second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as I made this reply, we arrived at the house where we
had lodged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
Captain Levee was a man, who, when once he had decided,
was as rapid as lightning in execution. He sent for a dealer in
horses, concluded a bargain with him in five minutes, paid his
lodgings and all demands upon him, and before noon we were
both on board of our respective vessels. But, previous to the
seamen coming up for our boxes, I observed to him, &ldquo;I should
wish, Levee, that you would let me know, if it is only at a rough
guess, what sum I may be indebted to you; as I may be fortunate,
and if so, it will be but fair to repay you the money,
although your kindness I cannot so easily return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly,&rdquo; said Levee. &ldquo;If I take no prizes this
cruise, and you do make money, why then we will, on our return,
have another frolic somewhere, and you shall stand treat. That
will make us all square, if I am not fortunate; but if I am, I
consider your pleasant company to have more than repaid me for
any little expense I may have incurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind to say that,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but I hope you
will be fortunate, and not have to depend upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so too,&rdquo; he replied, laughing. &ldquo;If we come back
safe and sound, we will take a trip to Bath&mdash;I am anxious to see
the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mention this conversation, Madam, that I may make you
acquainted with the character of Captain Levee, and prove to you
how worthy a man I had as a companion.</p>

<p>It required about ten days to complete my little schooner with
every thing that I considered requisite, and the politeness of the
owner was extremely gratifying. We were, however, but just
complete, when the owner sent for me in a great hurry, and
having taken me into a back room next to the counting-house, he
locked the door, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Elrington, I have been offered a large sum to do a
service to some unfortunate people; but it is an affair which, for
our own sakes, will demand the utmost secrecy: indeed, you
will risk more than I shall; but at the same time I trust you will
not refuse to perform the service, as I shall lose a considerable
advantage. If you will undertake it, I shall not be ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
I replied that I was bound to him by many acts of kindness,
and that he might confide in my gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he replied, lowering his voice, &ldquo;the fact is
this; four of the Jacobite party, who are hotly pursued, and for
whose heads a large reward is offered, have contrived to escape
to this port, and are here concealed by their friends, who have
applied to me to land them at some port in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I will cheerfully execute the
commission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Captain Elrington; I expected no other answer
from you. I would not put them on board Captain Levee&rsquo;s vessel
for many reasons; but, at the same time, he knows that he is to
sail to-morrow, and he shall wait for you and keep company with
you till you have landed them; after which you may concert your
own measures with him, and decide whether you cruise together
or separate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Levee will of course know that I have them on
board?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but it is to conceal these people from others in
his ship, and not from him, that they are put on board of your
vessel. At the same time, I confess I have my private reasons
as well, which I do not wish to make known. You can sail to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can sail to-night, if you wish,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; to-morrow night will be the time that I have fixed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time will they come on board?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot reply to that till to-morrow. The fact is, that the
government people are on a hot scent; and there is a vessel of
war in the offing, I am told, ready to board any thing and every
thing which comes out. Captain Levee will sail to-morrow morning,
and will in all probability be examined by the government
vessel, which is, I understand, a most rapid sailer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he submit to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he must; and I have given him positive orders not to
make the least attempt to evade her or prevent a search. He will
then run to Holyhead, and lay-to there for you to join him, and
you will proceed together to the port which the people taken on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
board shall direct, for that is a part of the agreement they have
made with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then of course I am to evade the king&rsquo;s vessel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; and I have no doubt but that you will be able so
to do. Your vessel is so fleet, that there will be little difficulty:
at all events, you will do your best: but recollect, that although
you must make every attempt to escape, you must not make any
attempt at resistance&mdash;indeed, that would be useless against a
vessel of such force. Should you be in a position which might
enable them to board you, you must find some safe hiding-place
for your passengers; for I hardly need say, that if taken with
them on board, the vessel will be confiscated, and you will run
some danger of your life. I have nothing more to say to you just
now, except that you may give out that Captain Levee sails to-morrow,
and that you are to follow him in ten days. Your powder
is on board?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I got it on board as soon as we hauled out in the
stream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you will call here to-morrow morning about
eleven o&rsquo;clock, not before, and (I hardly need repeat it), but I
again say&mdash;secrecy,&mdash;as you value your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as I had left the owner, I went down to the wharf,
stepped into the boat, and went on board Captain Levee&rsquo;s vessel,
which, I have omitted to state, was named the Arrow. I found
him on board, and very busy getting ready for sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are off to-morrow, Levee?&rdquo; said I, before all the
people on the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I was, too; but I am to remain ten days longer, I
find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in hopes we should have cruised together,&rdquo; replied
Captain Levee; &ldquo;but we must do as our owner wishes. What
detains you?&mdash;I thought you were ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so too,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but we find that the head of
the mainmast is sprung, and we must have a new one. I have
just come from the owner&rsquo;s, and must set to work at once, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
get ready for shifting our mast. So, fare you well, if I do not
see you before you sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to see the owner to-night,&rdquo; replied Levee. &ldquo;Shall
we not meet then, and take a parting glass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not, but I will come if I can,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;if not,
success to the Arrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And success to the Sparrow-Hawk!&rdquo; replied Levee, &ldquo;and
God bless you, my good fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook hands with my kind friend, and went over the side of
the lugger into my boat, and then pulled for my own vessel. As
soon as I got on board, I sent for the officers and men, and said
to them&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are to shift our mainmast for one that is three feet
longer, and must work hard, that we may be able to sail as soon
as possible. I cannot allow any of you to go on shore till the
work is finished; when it is done, you will have leave as before
till we sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon I sent down the topsail-yard and topmast,
unbent the mainsail, main-topsail, and gaff&mdash;sent down the
topmast and running-rigging on deck&mdash;cast loose the lanyards
of the lower rigging, and quite dismantled the mainmast, so as
to make it appear as if we were about to haul to the wharf and take
it out. The men all remained on board, expecting that we should
shift our berth the next day.</p>

<p>On the following morning I laid out a warp to the wharf, as if
intending to haul in; and at the time appointed, I went on shore
to the owner, and told him what I had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I find that you will have to sail this night
as soon as it is dark. How will you get ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied that at nightfall I would immediately replace every
thing, and in an hour would be ready for sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If such be the case, you have done well, Mr. Elrington,
and I thank you for your zeal on my behalf, which I shall not
forget. Every thing has been arranged, and you must come up
here with some of your seamen as soon as you are ready to sail.
Your men, or rather four of them, must remain in the house.
The four gentlemen who are to be embarked will be dressed, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
seamen&rsquo;s attire, and will carry down their boxes and trunks as if
they were your men taking your things on board. You will then
remain a little distance from the wharf in the boat till your own
men come down, and if there is no discovery you will take them
on board with you; if, on the contrary, there is any suspicion,
and the officers of the government are on the watch, and stop
your men, you will then push off with the passengers, slip your
cable if it is necessary, and make all sail for Holyhead, where
you will fall in with the Arrow, which will be waiting there for
you. Is the Arrow still in sight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;she was out of sight more than an hour
ago, and from our masthead we could see the top-gallant sails of
the vessel of war bearing N.N.W.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep a look-out upon her, and see how she bears at dark,&rdquo;
replied the owner, &ldquo;for you must not fall in with her if possible.
I think you had better return on board now, that you may keep
your people quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I arrived on board the schooner, I told my officers that
I did not think that we should shift the mast as proposed, and
that every thing must be got ready for refitting. I did not choose
to say more, but I added that I was to go on shore in the evening
to smoke a pipe with the owner, and then I should know for
certain. I employed the men during the whole of the day in doing
every thing in preparation which could be done without exciting
suspicion; and as soon as it was dark I called the men aft, and
told them that I thought it was very likely, from the Arrow not
having made her appearance, that we might be sent to join her
immediately, and that I wished them to rig the mainmast, and
make every thing ready for an immediate start, promising them
to serve out some liquor if they worked well. This was sufficient,
and in little more than an hour the mast was secured, the rigging
all complete, and the sails ready for bending. I then ordered
the boat to be manned, and telling the officers that they were to
bend the sails, and have every thing ready for weighing on my
return on board, which would be in an hour, or thereabouts, I
pulled on shore, and went up to the owner&rsquo;s, taking four men
with me, and leaving three men in the boat. I ordered these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
three men to remain till the others came down with my trunks and
effects, and not to leave the boat on any consideration.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the owner&rsquo;s, I told him what I had done,
and he commended my arrangements. In the back room I found
four gentlemen dressed in seamen&rsquo;s clothing, and as there was
no time to be lost, they immediately shouldered the trunks and
valises; desiring my own men to remain with the owner to bring
down any thing that he might wish to send on board, I left them
in the counting-house. The gentlemen followed me with their
loads down to the boat, and when I got there the men told me
that some people had come down and asked whose boat it was,
and why they were lying there, and that they had told the people
that the captain had taken four men with him to bring down his
things, and that they were waiting for him; so it was lucky that
I said to my men what I did.</p>

<p>We hastened to put the trunks into the boat, and to get in
ourselves after we had received this intelligence, and then I
shoved off from the wharf, and laid about a stone&rsquo;s throw distant
for my other men. At last we heard them coming down, and
shortly afterwards we perceived that they were stopped by other
people, and in altercation with them. I knew then that the officers
were on the alert, and would discover the stratagem, and
therefore desired my men and the gentlemen, who had each taken
an oar in readiness, to give way and pull for the schooner. As
we did so, the king&rsquo;s officers on search who had stopped my four
men came down to the wharf and ordered us to come back, but
we made no reply. As soon as we were alongside, we hoisted the
things out of the boat, veered her astern by a tow-rope, slipped
the cable, and made sail. Fortunately it was very dark, and we
were very alert in our movements. We could perceive lights at
the wharf as we sailed out of the river, and it was clear that we
had had a narrow escape; but I felt no alarm on account of the
owner, as I knew that although they might suspect, they could
prove nothing. When about three miles out we hove to, hoisted
in the boat, and shaped our course.</p>

<p>All I had now to fear was the falling in with the ship of war in
the offing, and I placed men to keep a sharp look-out in every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
direction, and told the officers that it was necessary that we should
avoid her. When last seen, about an hour before dark, she was
well to windward, and as the wind was from the northward, she
would probably sail faster than we could, as a schooner does not
sail so well free as on a wind. We had run out about four hours,
and were steering our course for Holyhead, when suddenly we
perceived the ship of war close to us, and to leeward. She had
been lying with her mainsail to the mast, but she evidently had
made us out, for she filled and set top-gallant sails.</p>

<p>I immediately hauled my wind, and as soon as she had way,
she tacked and followed in pursuit, being then right astern of us,
about half a mile off. It was very dark, and I knew that as our
sails were set, and we bore from her, it would be difficult for her
to keep us in sight, as we only presented what we call the feather-edge
of our sails to her. I therefore steered on under all sail, and
finding that the schooner weathered on her, I kept her away a
little, so as to retain the same bearings, and to leave her faster.</p>

<p>In an hour we could not make out the ship, and were therefore
certain that she could not see us; so, as I wanted to get clear
of her, and be at Holyhead as soon as possible, I lowered down
all the sails and put my helm up, so as to cross her and run to
leeward under bare poles, while she continued her windward
chase. This stratagem answered, and we saw no more of her;
for, two hours afterwards, we fell in with the Arrow, and, hailing
her, we both made sail down the Bristol Channel as fast as we
could, and at daybreak there was no vessel in sight, and of course
we had nothing more to fear from the Liverpool cruiser.</p>

<p>As we now sailed rapidly along in company, with the wind on
our quarter, it was high time for me to look to my passengers,
who had remained on deck in perfect silence from the time that
they had come on board. I therefore went up to them, and apologized
for not having as yet paid them that attention that I should
have wished to have done under other circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; replied the oldest of them, with a courteous salute,
&ldquo;you have paid us every attention; you have been extremely
active in saving our lives, and we return you our sincere thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; replied a young and handsome man who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
stood next him, &ldquo;Mr. Elrington has saved us from the toils of
our enemies; but now that we are in no fear from that quarter, I
must tell him that we have hardly had a mouthful of food for
twenty-four hours, and if he wishes to save our lives a second
time, it will be by ordering a good breakfast to be prepared
for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Campbell speaks the truth, my dear Sir,&rdquo; said the one who
had first spoken. &ldquo;We have lately gained the knowledge of what
it is to hunger and thirst; and we all join in his request.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not wait long,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I will be up again in
a moment or two.&rdquo; I went down into the cabin, and ordering my
servant to put on the table a large piece of pressed Hamburg beef,
a cold pie of various flesh and fowl combined, some bread and
cheese, and some bottles of brandy and usquebaugh, I then went
up again, and requested them all to descend. Hungry they certainly
were, and it was incredible the quantity that they devoured.
I should have imagined that they had not been fed for a week;
and I thought that if they were to consume at that rate, my stock
would never last out, and the sooner they were landed the better.
As soon as they left off eating, and had finished two bottles of
usquebaugh, I said to them, &ldquo;Gentlemen, my orders are to land
you at any port of France that you should prefer. Have you made
up your minds as to which it shall be, for it will be necessary that
we shape a course according to your decision?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Elrington, on that point we would wish to advise with
you. I hardly need say that our object is to escape, and that
falling in with and being captured by a ship of war, and there are
many out in pursuit of us and other unfortunate adherents to the
house of Stuart, would be extremely disagreeable, as our heads
and our bodies would certainly part company, if we were taken.
Now, which port do you think we should be most likely to reach
with least chance of interruption?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as you pay me the compliment to ask
my opinion, that it would be better to run down the Bay of Biscay,
and then put in the port of Bordeaux, or any other, where you
could be landed in safety; and my reason is this: the Channel is
full of cruisers looking after those of your party who are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
attempting to escape; and my vessel will be chased and searched.
Now, although we might sail faster than any one vessel in the
Channel, yet it is very possible that in running away from one,
we may fall into the jaws of another. And besides, we are two
privateers, and cruising off Bordeaux will excite no suspicion, as
it is a favourite cruising-ground; so that, if we were boarded,
there would be little danger of discovery; but, of course, as long
as I can prevent that, by taking to my heels, I shall not be boarded
by any one. The only objection to what I propose is, that you
will be confined longer in a vessel than you may like, or than you
would be if you were to gain a nearer port.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with the captain of the vessel,&rdquo; said a grave-looking
personage, who had not yet spoken, and whom I afterwards discovered
to be a Catholic priest, &ldquo;the stanchest adherent to the
cause could not have given better advice, and I should recommend
that it be followed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others were of the same opinion; and, in consequence,
I edged the schooner down to the Arrow, and hailed Captain
Levee, stating that we were to run to Bordeaux. After that I prepared
for them sleeping accommodations as well as I could, and
on my making apologies, they laughed, and told me such stories
of their hardships during their escape, that I was not surprised at
their not being difficult. I found out their names by their addressing
one another, to be Campbell, M&lsquo;Intyre, Ferguson, and
M&lsquo;Donald; all of them very refined gentlemen, and of excellent
discourse. They were very merry, and laughed at all that they
had suffered; sang Jacobite songs, as they were termed, and certainly
did not spare my locker of wine. The wind continued fair,
and we met with no interruption, and on the fourth evening, at
dusk, we made the mouth of the Garonne, and then hove to, with
our heads off shore, for the night. Captain Levee then came on
board, and I introduced him to my passengers. To my surprise,
after some conversation, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have now escorted Captain Elrington, according to the
orders I received, and shall return to Liverpool as soon as possible;
if, therefore, gentlemen, you have any letters to send to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
your friends announcing your safety, I shall be most happy to
present them in any way you may suggest as most advisable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That Captain Levee had some object in saying this, I was
quite certain; and therefore I made no remark. The passengers
thanked him for his proposal; and, being provided with writing
materials, they all wrote to their friends, and put their letters into
Captain Levee&rsquo;s hands, who then bade them farewell, and went
on deck with me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you were not serious in what you said, Captain
Levee?&rdquo; I inquired, as we walked forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but I considered it prudent to make them
believe so. Although Englishmen, they are enemies to our
country, so far as they are enemies to our government, and, of
course, wish no harm to the French, who have so warmly supported
them. Now, if they knew that I remained here waiting for
your coming out of the river, they would say so, and I might lose
the chance of a good prize, as nothing would sail, if they knew
that the coast was not clear. Now, I shall part company with you
in an hour, and make all sail for England, as they may suppose,
but without fail, to-morrow night I shall be off here again, about
five leagues from the port, with my sails furled; therefore, stay
in the river as long as they will let you, as, while you are in port
with the flag of truce, vessels may sail out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you, and will do all I can to assist your views,
Captain Levee. Now, we will go down again. I will give you a
receipt for a coil of rope, which you will send your boat for, and
write a letter to the owners, after which you will wish me good
bye, and make sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Captain Levee replied, who then ordered his boat
to go for a coil of three inch, and bring it on board.</p>

<p>We then descended to the cabin, and I wrote a letter to the
owner, and also a receipt for the coil of rope, which I delivered to
Captain Levee. The boat soon returned from the lugger, the
rope was taken on board, and then Captain Levee wished me
farewell, and made his polite adieus to the gentlemen who followed
him on deck, and waited there till he had hoisted in his
boat, and made all sail.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
&ldquo;How long will she be before she arrives at Liverpool with
this wind?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will carry her canvas night and day,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and,
therefore, as she sails so fast, I should say in five or six days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am grateful that we have such an early and safe opportunity
of communicating with our friends in England, we
might have waited two months otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;but Heaven has assisted
our anxious wishes. Let us be grateful for all things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My passengers watched the lugger until she was nearly out of
sight. I dare say that their thoughts were, that those on board
of her were going to the country of their birth, from which they
were exiles, probably for ever: they did not speak, but went
down below, and retired to their beds. At daylight the next
morning I ran the schooner in; and as soon as I was within three
miles of the coast, I hoisted the white flag of truce, and stood
for the mouth of the river Garonne. I perceived that the batteries
were manned, but not a shot was fired, and we entered the
river.</p>

<p>When we were a mile up the river, we were boarded by the
French authorities, and my passengers, who had dressed themselves
in their proper costume, informed the officer in the boat
who they were, upon which he was very polite, and calling a
pilot out of the boat, the schooner was taken charge of by him,
and we very soon afterwards, having wind and tide in our favour,
were anchored alongside of two large merchant vessels and a
French privateer of sixteen guns, which I instantly recognized as
our old antagonist off Hispaniola, in the action in which the Revenge
was captured, and Captain Weatherall lost his life. However,
I kept my knowledge to myself, as the French officer and
the Jacobite gentleman were present. As soon as we had anchored,
the passengers were requested to go into the boat, and
the French officer and I to accompany them, that I might report
myself to the governor, and we pulled away to the town, one of
my boats following with the passengers&rsquo; luggage.</p>

<p>On our landing, there was a great crowd assembled, and
they looked very hard at me, as I was dressed in my lace coat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
and a cocked-up hat, also bound with broad gold lace. On our
arrival in the presence of the governor, we were received with
much urbanity; and as I had brought the Jacobite gentlemen in
my schooner, it was presumed that I was favourable to the cause,
and I was very politely treated. The governor invited us all to
dine with him on that day. I made some excuse, saying, that I
was anxious to return to Liverpool; that I might fit out for the
coast of Africa, in which service I was to be employed by my
owners; but the passengers insisted upon my staying a day or
two, and the governor added to their solicitations, his own.</p>

<p>I therefore accepted, not only because I was glad to have an
opportunity to see so celebrated a town, but because it would
meet the views of Captain Levee. We took leave of the governor,
and went to an hotel, and I then sent my boat on board for necessaries,
and hired a handsome apartment in the hotel. I had
not been there half an hour, when the priest came to me and said,
&ldquo;Captain, you are not aware of the rank and consequence of the
three gentlemen whom you have been so successful in escorting
to a place of safety. I am requested by them to make you a handsome
remuneration for your kindness and skilful conduct on this
occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that must not be. I am most happy in
having assisted in the escape of unfortunate gentlemen; and all
the pleasure I feel at having so done would be destroyed if I were
to accept of what you offer. It is useless to repeat it; and if you
do, I shall consider it an insult, and immediately repair on
board of my vessel. You will therefore tender my best thanks
and my refusal, with ardent wishes for their future welfare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After what you have said, Captain Elrington, I will, of
course, not resume the offer. I will tell my fellow-passengers
what you have said, and I am sure that they will, as I do, admire
your high sense of honour.&rdquo;&mdash;The priest shook me by the
hand, and then quitted my apartment. I did not see the other
passengers till it was the hour to go to dine at the governor&rsquo;s,
when they embraced me cordially, and the one calling himself
Campbell said, &ldquo;Should you ever be in distress or a prisoner in
this country, recollect you have a friend who is ready to serve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
you. Here is an address to a lady, to whom you must write, and
say that you wish the assistance of your passenger to Bordeaux&mdash;that
will be sufficient&mdash;I trust you may never require it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had a pleasant dinner at the governor&rsquo;s, and among the
people invited to meet us, I perceived the French captain of the
privateer. I knew him immediately, although he did not recognize
me. We had some conversation together, and he spoke
about his cruises in the West Indies, and asked me whether I
knew Captain Weatherall. I said there was a Captain Weatherall
who commanded the Revenge privateer, and who was killed when
his vessel was taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;he was a brave man, and
fought nobly, and so did all his people&mdash;they fought like
devils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;they fought as long as they could, but
Captain Weatherall was very short-handed. He had but fifty-five
men on board at the commencement of the action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied the French captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had not, I assure you,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;he had lost so
many in an attack on shore, and had so many away in prizes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our conversation had attracted general notice, and a French
army officer observed, &ldquo;Monsieur speaks so positively, that one
would imagine that he was actually on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I was, Sir,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and have my wounds to
show for it. I knew this officer immediately I saw him, for I was
close to Captain Weatherall at the time that this officer expostulated
with him before the action; and I crossed my sword with
him during the combat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have convinced me that you were on board,&rdquo; replied
the captain of the privateer, &ldquo;by your mentioning the expostulations
previous to the combat taking place. I am delighted to have
met with so brave an enemy, for every man on board that vessel
was a hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation was then general, and many particulars
were asked; and I will do the French captain the justice to say,
that he was very correct in all his statements, and neither vaunted
his own success, nor did us less than justice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
The party then broke up to go to the theatre, and afterwards
we repaired to the hotel. I remained there two days more, and
on the last of these two days I had promised to sup with the
French captain of the privateer, who had called upon me, and
behaved very politely. The following day, after noon, when the
tide served, I was to sail. Accordingly, after the theatre was
over, I went with the French captain to his house, in company
with two or three more. Supper was on the table when we arrived
there, and we went into the room, waiting for the presence of the
captain&rsquo;s lady, who had not gone to the theatre, and to whom I
had not been introduced. After a few minutes she made her appearance,
and as she entered the room, I was struck with her
extreme beauty, although she was past the meridian of life. I
thought I had seen her face before, and as she came forward with
her husband, it at once rushed into my mind that she was the
widow of the French gentleman who had so gallantly fought his
vessel, and who fell by my hand&mdash;the lady who was nursing her
son at the King&rsquo;s Hospital at Jamaica, and who had been so inveterate
against me. Our eyes met, and her cheeks flushed;
she recognized me, and I coloured deeply as I bowed to her. She
was taken with a faintness, and fell back. Fortunately her husband
received her in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, my love?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing; but I am taken with a vertigo,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;it
will go off directly. Make my excuses to the company, while I
retire for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her husband went out of the room, and after a minute or two
came back, saying that Madam was not well enough to return to
the room, and begged that they would admit her excuse, and sit
down to supper without her. Whether his wife had informed
him of who I was, I know not; but nothing could exceed the civility
of the French captain towards me during the supper. We
did not, however, remain very late, as the lady of the house was
indisposed.</p>

<p>I found out, as I walked home with another French officer,
that the captain of the privateer had fallen in with the French lady
on her return from Jamaica, where her son died in the hospital,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
and had married her; and that, moreover, unlike most French
husbands, he was most ardently attached to her.</p>

<p>I had breakfasted the next morning, and packed up my clothes
preparatory to going on board, and had just returned from a visit
of leave-taking with the governor, when who should walk up into
my apartment but the French captain of the privateer, accompanied
by three or four French officers of the army. I perceived by
his looks when he entered that he was a little excited, but I met
him cordially. He began a conversation about his action with
Captain Weatherall, and instead of speaking handsomely as he
had done before, he used expressions which I considered offensive,
and I at once took him up by observing that being under a
flag of truce, it was impossible for me to notice what he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but I wish we were once more on the
high seas together, for I have a little debt of gratitude to pay
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you may have; and I should not be
sorry to give you an opportunity, if it were possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I inquire whether you intend to go home as a cartel,
and carry your flag of truce to Liverpool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I shall haul down my flag of truce as
soon as I am out of gun-shot of your batteries. I understand what
you mean, Sir. It is very true that your vessel carries nearly
double the number of men and guns that mine does, but nevertheless
I shall haul down my flag of truce, as I say I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I follow you down the river, I presume?&rdquo; he said with
a sort of sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, if you dare,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;you will meet with your
master, depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sacre!&rdquo; replied he, in a passion, &ldquo;I will blow you out of
the water; and if I take you I will hang you for a pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the last, certainly,&rdquo; I said coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look you, Sir,&rdquo; he cried, shutting his fist upon the palm
of his other hand, &ldquo;if I take you, I will hang you; and if you
take me, you may serve me in the same way. Is it a bargain, or
are you a coward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I said to the officers present, &ldquo;you must feel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
that your countryman is not behaving well. He has insulted me
grossly. I will, however, consent to his terms on one condition,
which is, that he will permit one of you, after he has sailed, to
make known the conditions upon which we fight to his wife; and
that one of you will pledge me his honour that he will impart
these conditions as soon as we are gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agree to do so&mdash;pledge yourself to do so, Xavier,&rdquo; cried
the French captain to one of the officers present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you wish it, certainly,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You pledge yourself to make the conditions known to Madam,
as soon as we have sailed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, upon the honour of an officer and a gentleman,&rdquo; replied
he, &ldquo;painful as it will be to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, captain,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I agree to your conditions,
and one or the other of us shall hang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may suppose, Madam, that I must have been in a state
of great irritation to have consented to such terms. I was so,
and could not brook such insult in the presence of the French
officers. Moreover, as you will observe, in my conversation I
did not commit myself in any way. There was nothing dishonourable.
I told him that I should haul down my flag of truce,
and I also told him that he would meet with his master, which
was true enough, as he would meet with the Arrow, commanded
by Captain Levee, as well as with my vessel; while he thought
that he would have to fight with my inferior vessel alone, and,
making sure of conquest, he purposely insulted me, to make me
accept such conditions as would administer to the revenge of his
wife, who had evidently worked him up to act in such a manner;
and I accepted them, because I hoped the fate would be his if
Captain Levee joined me, and if not, I was determined that I
never would be taken alive.</p>

<p>After I had agreed to his conditions, they all took a very ceremonious
leave, and I bowed them out with great mock humility.
I then bade farewell to my passengers, who lodged in the same
hotel, and went down to my boat, and pulled on board. As soon
as the tide served, the pilot came on board, and we got under
weigh. I observed a great bustle, and a hurrying to and fro of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
boats on board of the French privateer, and we had not gone above
two miles down the river, before I perceived the men were aloft
and lowering her sails. I told my officers that I had received a
challenge from the French privateer, and had accepted it, and
that we must get every thing ready for action. They were much
astonished at this, as the disparity of force was so great, but they
went cheerfully to their duty, as did the men, among whom
the news was soon spread.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p>Captain Levee and I engage with the French Privateer&mdash;We come off
victorious&mdash;My revenge against the French Lady&mdash;We take our Prize
to Liverpool.</p></div>


<p>The wind was light, and we did not gain the mouth of the
river till near sun-down, when the pilot left us; and as soon as
we were three miles in the offing, I hauled down the flag of truce
in the sight of the French privateer, who was following us close,
and was not more than four miles from us. To avoid mistake, I
had agreed with Captain Levee that should I be coming out after
dark, I would carry a light at the peak, and this light I now
hoisted. It enabled the French privateer to follow me, and
appeared only as a mark of contempt towards him. I stood on in
the direction where I was to find Captain Levee, and could make
out the Frenchman following me, and gradually nearing me. As
it became dark I made more sail to keep him further off till I had
joined the Arrow, but the light at my peak pointed out to him
where I was. All this seemed a mystery to my officers and men,
until having run out about four leagues, I desired them to keep a
sharp look-out for the Arrow.</p>

<p>About half-past eight o&rsquo;clock we perceived her lying-to; she
had furled her sails after dark, as usual. The light I bore told
her who I was, and I ran close to her, and, hailing Captain Levee,
desired him to prepare for action, and that I would come on
board to speak to him. This, of course, created a great bustle
on board of the Arrow, and I hastened on board that they might
not show any lights. I then informed Captain Levee of all that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
had passed, and that the Frenchman was not more than five
miles from us. We agreed that I should still keep up the light,
and bear away a little to draw the Frenchman to leeward of the
port, and also to leeward of the Arrow;&mdash;that the Arrow should
lower her sails again, so as not to be perceived until I had drawn
the Frenchman past him, and that then I should commence the
action under sail, and fight till the Arrow came up to my assistance.
This being arranged, I hastened on board of my
schooner, and keeping away four points, I waited for the coming
up of my antagonist. In half an hour we could perceive him
through the gloom, not more than a mile from us, under all sail,
standing steadily for the light which we carried at our peak.</p>

<p>As I had already discovered that my little schooner sailed
faster than my opponent, I allowed her to come up within a quarter
of a mile of me, when I rounded to; and desiring my men to
aim at his rigging, so as to dismantle him, poured in my broadside
of grape and langridge, and then shifted my helm and resumed
my course, putting more sail on, so as to increase my
distance to what it was before. This man&oelig;uvre I executed three
times with success, and I had the satisfaction of perceiving that
his foretop-mast was shot away; but when I rounded-to the
fourth time, he did the same, and we exchanged broadsides.
The effect of his superior artillery was evident, for my rigging
and sails were much damaged; happily nothing so serious as to
impede our speed, and I again put before the breeze as before,
and increased my distance previous to again rounding-to; for,
as the water was very smooth, I knew that if I was crippled she
would lay me by the board immediately, and I might be taken
and hanged before the Arrow could come up to my assistance. I
therefore continued a running fight at such a distance as rendered
me less liable to suffer from his guns.</p>

<p>It is true that this distance made my guns even more ineffective,
but I was decoying my Frenchman off from the land, and
placing the Arrow between him and his port, so that his return
would be intercepted. This continued for about an hour, when
I perceived that the Frenchman had got up a new foretop-mast,
and had set the sail upon it. He now ran out his bow-chasers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
and continued to fire upon me with them alone, not choosing to
lose ground by rounding-to, to give me a broadside; and as his
canvas was all out, and I was occasionally rounding-to to dismantle
him, we retained much the same distance from one
another. At last a shot from his bow-chaser struck off the head
of my mainmast, and my gaff came down.</p>

<p>This was serious. We hastened to reef the mainsail, and
hoist it up again upon the remainder of the mast, but having no
gaff-topsail, our speed was necessarily decreased, and the enemy
appeared to be gradually closing with us. I looked out for the
Arrow, but could perceive no signs of her; indeed it was too
dark to see farther than half a mile. Finding that on the point of
sailing we were on I had no chance, I determined to alter my
course, and put my schooner right before the wind, so that I
might set the square mainsail, which would give time for the
Arrow to arrive; indeed at this time I was in a state of great
anxiety. However, I had made up my mind not to be taken alive,
and to sell my life as dearly as I could.</p>

<p>When the enemy perceived that we had put before the wind,
he did the same, and as we were about half a mile from each
other, we continued to exchange broadsides as we ran, she gradually
nearing us so as to make her heavy artillery more effective.
This portion of the contest continued for an hour, during which
my little schooner had received much injury, and we were constantly
repairing damages. At last, much to my delight, the
day began to dawn, and I then discovered the Arrow about a mile
and a half from us, right astern, under a press of sail.</p>

<p>I pointed her out to my officers and men, who were inspired
with fresh courage at the sight. The enemy also perceived her,
and appeared determined to bring the combat to an issue previous
to her coming up, and I feared that, at all events, I might
swing at the yard-arm, let the issue of the coming combat be
what it might. She neared, steering a course so as to cut me off,
and I continued to pour in my broadsides to cripple her if possible,
as she did not now fire, but ran steadily for me, and my
chances were bad.</p>

<p>Anxious that the Arrow should close as soon as possible, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
hauled down my square mainsail, that we might not run from
her, and prepared for an obstinate resistance if boarded. At
last the Frenchman was within a cable&rsquo;s length, and at this critical
moment the Arrow was about a mile to windward. We poured
in our last broadside, and hastened to seize our pikes and cutlasses
to repel the boarders, when to my satisfaction I found that
one of our shot had cut his gaff in two. I immediately rounded
to the wind; and as my antagonist was within pistol-shot of me,
with her men all ready for the leap on board, I put my helm down,
went round in stays, and crossed her so near to windward that
you might have thrown a biscuit on board.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre prevented his boarding, and I may say saved
my life, for his gaff being shot away, he could not heave in stays
to follow me, but was obliged to wear round after me, which increased
his distance at least a cable&rsquo;s length to leeward. A furious
broadside, however, which he poured in, crippled me
altogether. Every thing came running down upon the decks,
and I was left a complete wreck; but I was to windward of him,
and although he might sink me, he could not board or take possession
until he had refitted his after-sail.</p>

<p>But now his time was come. A fresh antagonist, with equal
weight of metal, was close to him, and he had to decide whether
he would fight or run. Whether he conceived that running was
useless, which it certainly was, or was determined to take us
both or die, I know not, certain it is that he did not put his vessel
before the wind, but waited with determination the coming up of
the Arrow. Captain Levee passed under the Frenchman&rsquo;s stern,
raking him with a broadside that almost unrigged him, and then
engaged him to leeward, so as to cut off all chance of his escape.</p>

<p>The Frenchman returned the fire with spirit, and I took my
men from my guns that we might set some sail upon the vessel,
for after the Arrow commenced her fire no further notice was
taken of me by the Frenchman. After a contest well maintained
for half an hour, the mainmast of the Frenchman went by the
board, and this almost settled the question, as he could not
keep his vessel to the wind, and consequently she fell off, and
received a raking fire from the Arrow. At last her bowsprit was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
between the main and fore rigging of the Arrow, and her decks
were swept by the Arrow&rsquo;s raking fire. I had got some sail up
forward, and was anxious to be at the close of the action. I perceived
that the Frenchman was attempting to board the lugger,
and was pouring all his people on the forecastle, and I therefore
edged down to him that I might, with my people, board him on
the quarter, which would place him, as we say, between two
fires. The conflict was at its highest; the French attempting and
the Arrow&rsquo;s crew repelling them, when I laid my schooner on her
quarter, and leaped on board of her with my few remaining men.
The Frenchmen turned to repel my attack, and thus weakened
their party opposed to the Arrow&rsquo;s men; the consequence was,
that they were first beaten back, and then boarded by Captain
Levee and his crew.</p>

<p>As soon as I had gained the deck of the Frenchman, I thought
of nothing but to single out the French captain. At first I could
not see him, but as his crew retreated from Captain Levee and
his men, I perceived him, pale and exhausted, but still attempting
to rally them. As my object was to take him alive, I rushed
in advance at him, wrestled, and threw him on his back on the
deck. There I held him, while the combatants fighting and retreating,
tumbled over us one after another, and bruised us
severely with their weight. At last the French were beaten below,
and I had time to breathe; calling to two of my men, I desired
them to take charge of the French captain, and as they valued
their lives, not to let him escape, or destroy himself, but to
take him into our vessel and guard him carefully in my cabin.
Having done this, I went to Captain Levee, and we embraced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not come a minute too soon,&rdquo; I said, wiping the
blood from my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; and but for your clever man&oelig;uvre, you would
have been beaten. Your vessel is a mere nutshell compared to
this;&mdash;you did well, more than well, to maintain the combat so
long. Have you lost many men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had ten sent below before we boarded; what may have
followed since I do not know. I have the French captain safe in
my cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
&ldquo;I saw the men hand him over:&mdash;well, now to repair damages,
and then I will tell you what you shall do. I must send
on board and help you; the Arrow has not suffered much considering,
and I can spare the men. As soon as we have cleared
up the decks a little, we will breakfast together, and talk the
matter over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It required two hours before we could clear the decks of our
vessels, for we had separated, and the Arrow had taken charge
of the prize. Before I took the boat to go on board the Arrow, I
went down into my cabin, where the French captain lay bound
and watched by two of the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are prepared to pay the penalty agreed upon, Monsieur?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, Sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I now understand what you
meant when you said that I should meet with my match. I have
no one to blame but myself. I urged you to the conditions, expecting
an easy and certain conquest with my superior vessel. I
have fallen into my own net, and there&rsquo;s an end of the matter&mdash;except
that when things go wrong, a woman is certain to be at the
bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware, Sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that your wife instigated
you to act as you did, or you would never have so behaved. In
attempting to revenge the death of one husband, she has lost
two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est vrai</i>,&rdquo; replied the Frenchman, composedly, and I
then quitted the cabin, and went on board of the Arrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Elrington,&rdquo; said Captain Levee, &ldquo;what do you intend
to do with the French captain? Is he to pay the forfeit, and
swing at the yard-arm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like hanging a man, especially a brave man, in cold
blood,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It was all his wife&rsquo;s doing, and he has confessed
as much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would certainly have hanged you,&rdquo; replied Levee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that I believe; but it would have been that he might
have a quiet life at home&mdash;not from any resentment against me.
Now I have no feeling of that kind to actuate me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
&ldquo;What will you do, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not hang him, certainly; and yet I should like to punish
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She deserves it,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee. &ldquo;Now, Elrington,
will you approve of my suggestion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this: they do not know that I have assisted in taking
the privateer, as they have no idea that I am here. As soon as
we have refitted her and your vessel, I will remain where I am.
You shall run into the mouth of the Garonne, with your colours
flying, and the English Jack over the French flag on board of the
prize. This will lead them to suppose that you have taken the
vessel without assistance. When just out of gun-shot, heave-to,
fire a gun, and then swing an effigy to the yard-arm, and remain
there, to make them suppose that you have hung the French
captain. At nightfall you can make sail and rejoin me. That
will punish her, and annoy them generally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do so; it is an excellent device, and she will never
know the truth for a long time to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We remained all that day refitting; in the evening I made
sail, in company with the French schooner, which was manned
by Captain Levee, and stood in shore. At break of the following
day I ran in, standing for the harbour, without my colours being
hoisted, and then it occurred to me that I would make their
disappointment greater, by allowing them first to imagine that
the victory was theirs; so, when about six miles off, I hoisted
French colours on the French schooner, and French colours over
English on board of my own.</p>

<p>I continued to stand on till within two miles and a half of the
batteries, and could see crowds flocking down to witness the
supposed triumphant arrival of their privateer into port; when of
a sudden I hauled my wind, hove-to, brailed up my sails, and
changed the colours, firing a gun in bravado. Allowing them
half an hour to comment upon this disappointment, I then fired
another gun, and hoisted up to the yard-arm the figure of a man,
composed of clothes stuffed with hay, made to represent the
French captain; and having so done, I remained during the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
whole forenoon, with my sails brailed up, that they might have
a clear view of the hanging figure. At last we perceived a large
boat, with a flag of truce coming out of the river. I remained
where I was, and allowing it to come alongside, I perceived in it
the French officer, who had pledged himself to give the conditions
of the combat to the lady; and seated by him was the French
captain&rsquo;s wife, with her head sunk down on her knees, and her
face buried in her handkerchief.</p>

<p>I saluted the officer as he came on the deck. He returned my
bow, and then said, &ldquo;Sir, the fortune of war has proved in your
favour, and I perceive that the conditions of the issue of the
combat have been adhered to on your side. Against that I have
not a word to say, as my friend would have as rigidly adhered to
them. But, Sir, we war not with the dead, and I have come off
at the request of his miserable wife, to beg that you will, now
that your revenge is satisfied, deliver up to her her husband&rsquo;s
body, that it may receive the rites of the Church, and Christian
burial. You surely, as a brave man, will not deny this small
favour to a woman whom you have twice deprived of her husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;on condition that his lady will step on
board and make the request herself, I will comply with it, but
on no other terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be most painful, and her feelings might well have
been spared such a trial as to meet your face again, and make
the request in person; but as you insist upon it, I will make
known your terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he went into his boat I ran down into the cabin, and desired
them to cast loose the French captain, saying to him, &ldquo;Sir,
your wife is here requesting your body, which she believes to be
swinging at the yard-arm, for I have put that trick into execution
to punish her. I never intended to take your life, and I shall
now do more, I shall give you not only life, but liberty&mdash;such
shall be my revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French captain stared as if confounded, but made no
reply. I then went on deck, where I found the lady had been
lifted up the side. They led her to me, and she fell on her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
knees, but the effort was too much for her, and she fainted away.
I ordered her to be taken down into the cabin, and, without any
explanation, desired the French officer to accompany her, not
wishing to be present at the unexpected meeting. I therefore
remained on deck, and ordering the men to lower down the
effigy, they did so, laughing at the French seamen in the boat,
who for the first time perceived, for they had not looked up
before, that it was only a sham captain. I looked over the side,
and told them that the captain was alive and well, and would be
in the boat very soon, at which they were greatly rejoiced. In the
mean time the explanation took place in the cabin, and after a
few minutes the French officer came up, and expressed his satisfaction
at what I had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given a lesson, Sir, without being guilty of barbarity.
Your conduct has been noble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was soon followed by the French captain and his lady, who
was now all gratitude, and would have kissed my hands, but I
prevented her, and said, &ldquo;Madam, at least now you have no
occasion to hate me. If I was so unfortunate, in self-defence,
as to slay your first husband, I have restored to you your second.
Let us, then, part in amity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French captain squeezed my hand, but said nothing.
I begged they would take some refreshment, but they were too
anxious to return and undeceive their friends, and requested
permission to go into the boat. Of course I consented, and as
the boat pulled away, the crew gave three huzzas, as a compliment
to us. When they were a mile in shore, I hauled down the
colours of both vessels, and made sail out to rejoin Captain
Levee, which I did in the evening, and then related all that had
passed.</p>

<p>He was much pleased with the result of the affair, and we then,
having consulted, considered it advisable to run back to Liverpool
with the prize, for she required so many hands to man her
as to render us by no means efficient vessels. Moreover, I have
omitted to state that while I was in the Garonne, the Arrow had
taken two good prizes, which she had manned and sent to Liverpool.
We therefore made sail to the northward, and in a week
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
were again in port, with our prize. We found that the other
vessels had arrived safe, and the owner was much pleased with
the results of this short and eventful cruise.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p>I cause myself to be dismissed from my Owner&rsquo;s Service&mdash;Am arrested&mdash;Conveyed
to London, and confined in the Tower&mdash;Am visited by a
Romish Priest, and through his interference obtain my Liberation&mdash;Set
off to Liverpool, and find my Owner and Captain Levee&mdash;Their
surprise&mdash;Miss Trevannion.</p></div>


<p>When I called upon our owner, which I did as soon as I had
dropped my anchor and furled sails, he embraced me, and then
led me into the back room next to his counting-house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Elrington,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;well as you managed to get
off the Jacobite gentlemen, there is a strong suspicion on the part
of the government, that they were on board of your vessel, and
that I was a party to their escape. Whether they will take any
measures now that you have returned, I know not; they may have
gained some intelligence, or they may worm out something, by
their emissaries, from those who compose your crew, and if so,
we must expect their vengeance. Now tell me where you landed
them, and all the events of your cruise, for I have heard but little
from those who brought in the prizes taken by the Arrow. Captain
Levee is too busy with his own vessel and the prize to come on
shore for these two hours, and I wish to talk with you alone upon
this affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After I had narrated all that had passed, and the manner in
which the French privateer had been captured, the owner said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the government spies, and there are plenty of them about,
find out from your crew that you landed passengers at Bordeaux,
depend upon it you will be arrested and examined, without you
get out of the way till the affair has blown over. Now, the men
will narrate in the taverns the curious history of this French
privateer, and in so doing cannot fail to state that you were on
shore in France. Now, Elrington, you have run the risk to
oblige me, and I must keep you out of difficulty; and, if you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
feel inclined to hide yourself for a time, I will of course pay all
your expenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;if they find out what has taken place, and
wish to get hold of me in consequence, I think it will be better to
brave it out. If I hide away, it will make them more anxious to
have me, and will confirm their suspicions that I am what they
are pleased to call a traitor; a reward will be offered for my apprehension,
and at any time that I do appear, the reward will
cause me to be taken up. If, on the contrary, I brave it out,
and if I am asked, say at once that I did land passengers, at all
events they will not make it high treason; so, with your leave, I
will stay. I hardly need say that I shall take the whole responsibility
on myself, and declare that I took them on board without
your knowledge; that you may rest assured of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On consideration, I think that your plan is the best,&rdquo; replied
my owner. &ldquo;I am grateful for your offer of screening me, which
I would not permit, were it not that I shall be useful to you if
any mischance takes place, and, if in prison, could be of no
service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the wisest course will be for you
at once to dismiss me from the command of the privateer, in
consequence of your having been informed that I carried passengers
and landed them in France. That step will prove you a
friend to the government, and will enable you, after a time, to
get me out of my scrape more effectually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sacrificing yourself, Elrington, and all for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, Sir. I am only securing a friend in case of need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you certainly are,&rdquo; replied my owner, squeezing my
hand. &ldquo;Well, it will be the best plan even for you, and so let
it be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will now return on board, and tell the officers that I
am dismissed. There is no time to be lost; and here comes Captain
Levee; so for the present, Sir, farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On my return on board, I called up the officers and men, and
told them that I had offended the owner, and that he had dismissed
me from the command of the privateer. One of the officers
inquired what I had done; and I said, before the men, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
it was for landing the passengers in France. They all condoled
with me, and expressed their sorrow at my leaving them, and I
believe that they were sincere. It was fortunate that I did as I had
done, for I found that the government emissaries were on board
at the time that I made the communication, and had already
gained the information from some of my crew. I ordered my
chest and bedding to be put into the boat, and as soon as they
were ready, I gave up the command to the first officer, and bidding
them all farewell, went down the side, and pulled on shore,
repairing to my former lodgings.</p>

<p>I had not been there two hours before I was arrested and
taken to prison. I was, however, very comfortably lodged, because
I was a state prisoner, and I presume that more respect is
paid to a man when he is to be drawn and quartered, and his head
set above the Tower gates, then a petty malefactor. The next day
I was summoned before what was called the Commission, and
asked whether I had not landed some people in France? I replied
immediately that I had done so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo; was the next inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They stated themselves to be Roman Catholic priests,&rdquo; replied
I, &ldquo;and such I believed them to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did I do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, in the first place, they paid me one hundred guineas
each; and, in the second, because I considered them mischievous,
dangerous men, conspiring against the government,
and that the sooner they were out of the country the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did I know that they were traitors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All Roman priests were traitors in my opinion, and I hated
them as bad as I did the French, but it is difficult to deal with a
priest, and I thought that I was performing a good service in ridding
the country of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else was privy to the affair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one; I had made the arrangement with them myself, and
not an officer or man on board knew any thing about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my owner, Mr. Trevannion, was he a party to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he was not; and on my return he dismissed me from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
the command of the privateer, as soon as he found out that I had
landed the priests in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great many more questions were put to me, all of which I
answered very cautiously, yet without apparent hesitation; and
after an examination of four hours, the president of the Commission
told me that I had been, by my own acknowledgment, aiding
and abetting the escape of malignant traitors, and prevented them
meeting their just fate on the scaffold. That, in so doing, I had
been guilty of treason, and must abide the sentence of the supreme
Commission in London, whither I should be sent the following
day. I replied that I was a loyal subject; that I hated the
French and Romish plotters, and that I had done what I considered
was best; that if I had done wrong, it was only an error in
judgment; and any one that said I was a traitor, lied in his
throat.</p>

<p>My reply was taken down, and I was sent back to prison.</p>

<p>The following afternoon the gaoler came into my room accompanied
by two persons, one of whom informed me that I was delivered
over to their custody to be taken to London. I was led
out, and at the door I found three horses, upon one of which I
was desired to mount. As soon as I was in the saddle, a rope
was passed from one leg to the other under the horse&rsquo;s belly,
so as to prevent my escape; and my horse was led between the
other two, upon which my keepers rode, each having a hand-rein
made fast from my horse&rsquo;s bridle to his own. A crowd was
assembled round the entrance of the gaol, and among the
lookers-on I perceived Captain Levee and my owner; but of
course I thought it imprudent to take any notice of them, and
they did not make any recognition of me.</p>

<p>I hardly need say, my dear Madam, how very revolting it was
to my feelings to be thus led away like a felon; but at the same
time I must acknowledge the courtesy of my conductors, who
apologized for being compelled to take such measures of security,
and on the way showed great kindness and good-feeling.</p>

<p>Every thing being arranged, we proceeded on our journey;
but it was late when we set off, owing to one of my conductors
being sent for by the commissioner, and having to wait for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
letters for nearly three hours. As it may be supposed, we could
not travel at speed, and we seldom went faster than a walk, which
I was sorry for, as I was anxious that the journey should be over,
and my fate decided as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Almost an hour after dark, a party of men rushed from the
side of the road, and some seizing the bridles of the horses, the
others threw the two conductors off their saddles by taking them
by the leg and heaving them over on the other side. This was
done so quickly, that the two men, who were well armed, had
not time to draw out a pistol or any other weapon of defence; and
as soon as they were on the ground, they were immediately seized
and overpowered. The faces of the men who had thus assailed
the king&rsquo;s officers were blackened so as to disguise them, but
from their voices I knew them to be the men and officers of the
privateer. &ldquo;Now then, Captain Elrington,&rdquo; said one of them,
&ldquo;be off with you as fast as possible, and we will take care of these
fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I still remained in my saddle, and although somewhat flurried
with the surprise of the attack, I had had time to recover myself,
and had decided upon my mode of behaviour. I felt as I had said
to the owner when we consulted together, that an escape now
would be only putting off the evil day, and that it was better to
meet the case boldly at once; so I rose in my stirrups, and said
to the men in a loud voice, &ldquo;My good fellows, I am much obliged
to you for your exertions in my behalf, as it proves your good-will,
but I cannot and will not take advantage of them. By some
mistake I am accused of being a traitor, when I feel that I am a
true and loyal subject, which I have no doubt will be fully established
upon my arrival in London. I cannot, therefore, take advantage
of this opportunity to escape. I respect the laws of my
country, and I beg you to do the same. Oblige me by releasing
the two gentlemen whom you have made your prisoners, and
assist them to remount their horses, for I am resolved that I will
go to London and be honourably acquitted. Once more, my lads,
many thanks for your kind intentions; and now I wish you farewell,
and if you would do me a great favour, you will disperse
peaceably, and leave us to proceed on our journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
The men perceived that I was in earnest, and therefore did as
I requested, and in another minute I was again alone with my two
keepers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have behaved honourably, Sir, and perhaps wisely,&rdquo;
observed one of my conductors, as he was about to remount his
horse. &ldquo;I will not ask you who those people were, although I
have no doubt but you recognized them yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I did not. I guessed from whence they
came, but I did not recognize any one individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave this cautious answer, although I had recognized Captain
Levee and one of my own officers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain Elrington, you have proved to us that you
may be trusted, and therefore, on your pledging your word that
you will not escape, we shall have a great pleasure in removing
all unpleasant precautions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly have proved that I would not escape, and
will readily give you my assurance that I will not alter my
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is sufficient, Sir,&rdquo; replied the officer; and he then cut
away the rope which bound my legs, and also look off the two
leading reins attached to the other horses. &ldquo;We shall now,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;proceed not only more pleasantly, but more rapidly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My conductors then mounted their horses, and we set off at a
good trot, and in an hour arrived at the place where we were to
put up for the night. We found supper prepared for us, and good
beds. My conductors now left me free of all restraint, and we
retired to our beds. The next day we continued our journey in
the same manner. My companions were pleasant and gentlemen-like
men, and we discoursed freely upon every topic; no one
could have imagined that I was a state prisoner.</p>

<p>We arrived at London on the fifth day, and I was then delivered
over to the keeper of the Tower, according to the instructions
that my conductors had received. They bade me farewell,
and promised that they would not fail to represent my conduct to
the authorities, and gave me hopes of a speedy release. I had
the same idea, and took possession of the apartments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
prepared for me (which were airy and well ventilated) with almost
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>On the third day after my arrival a Commission was sent to
the Tower to examine me, and I gave the same replies as before.
They were very particular in obtaining the descriptions of the
persons of those whom I had landed in France, and I answered
without disguise. I afterwards found out that I had done a very
foolish thing. Had I misrepresented their persons, it would have
been supposed that they really were four Catholic priests, but
from my exact description, they discovered that I had rescued the
four traitors (as they termed them) that they were most anxious
to secure and make an example of; and their annoyance at
this discovery had so angered them against me, that my
subsequent conduct could not create any feeling favourable
towards me.</p>

<p>Three weeks elapsed, and I was wearied of confinement. My
gaoler told me that he feared my case was a bad one; and after
another week had passed, he said that I was condemned as aiding
and abetting treason. I must say that I little expected this result,
and it quite overthrew me. I asked my gaoler what was his authority.
He said that so many people had assisted and effected
the escape of the rebels without one having been convicted of
having so done except myself, on my own avowal, that they
deemed it absolutely necessary that an example should be made,
to deter others from aiding those who were still secreted in the
country; and that in consequence it had been decided by the Privy
Council that I should be made an example of. He told me much
more which I need not repeat, except that it proved the malignant
feeling that was indulged by the powers in authority against those
who had assisted their defeated opponents, and I felt that I had
no chance, and prepared my mind to meet my fate.</p>

<p>Alas, my dear Madam, I was but ill-prepared to die,&mdash;not
that I feared death, but I feared what must be my condition after
death. I had lived a reckless, lawless life, without fear of God
or man; all the religious feelings which had been instilled into
me by my good tutor (you know my family history, and I need
say no more) during my youth, had been gradually sapped away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
by the loose companionship which I had held since the time that
I quitted my father&rsquo;s house; and when I heard that I was to die,
my mind was in a state of great disquiet and uncomfortable
feeling. I wished to review my life, and examine myself, but I
hardly knew where to begin.</p>

<p>All was chaos and confusion. I could remember many bad
actions, but few good ones. I felt that I was like a vessel without
a rudder, and without a pilot; and after hours and hours of deep
thought, I would give up the task of examination in stern despair,
saying to myself, &ldquo;Well, if it must be so, it must.&rdquo; I felt an
inclination to defy that Heaven which I felt would never be
opened to me. This was the case for more than a week after I
heard of my condemnation, until I began to reflect upon the nature
of our creed, and the terms of salvation which were offered;
and, as I thought over them, I felt a dawn of hope, and I requested
the gaoler to furnish me with a Bible. I read it day and
night, for I expected every morning to be summoned to execution.
I felt almost agony at times, lest such should be the case;
but time passed on, and another fortnight elapsed, during which
I had profited by my reading, and felt some contrition for my
many offences, and my life of guilt, and I also felt that I could
be saved through the merits of Him who died for the whole world.
Day after day my faith became more lively, and my mind more at
ease. One morning the gaoler came to me, and said that there
was a priest who wished to see me. As I understood he was a
Roman, I was about to refuse; but on consideration, I thought
otherwise, and he was admitted. He was a tall, spare man,
with a dark Spanish countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are, I believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Captain Elrington, who
effected the escape of some of our poor friends, and who are now
condemned for your kind act?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, Sir,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that your profession of faith is not
mine, and do not, therefore, come to talk with you on serious
points, without you should wish it yourself; my object is, being
indebted as we are to you for saving our friends, to offer to be of
any use that I can to you, in executing any wishes, or delivering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
any messages, which you may wish to give, should you suffer
for your generous conduct, and you may trust any thing to me
with safety, that I swear to you;&rdquo; and he took a crucifix from
the folds of his garment, and kissed it, as he said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your kind offer, Sir,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;but I
have nothing to trouble you with. I have long quitted my family,
who know not whether I am alive or dead, for reasons that I need
not explain. I am under an assumed name, and it is my intention
to suffer under that name, that my family may not be disgraced
by my ignominious death, or be aware that I have perished
on the scaffold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; replied the priest; &ldquo;but let us talk
upon another point; have you no friends that could exert themselves
in your favour so as to procure your pardon and release?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;except those who, I am sure, are
exerting themselves to the utmost of their power, and to whom
no message from me is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know nobody at court,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;no person
of rank in the government&mdash;or I may say opposed to the
government&mdash;for people now-a-days are not what they seem or
pretend to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no knowledge of any titled person,&rdquo; replied I;
&ldquo;when I parted with one of the gentlemen whom I landed at Bordeaux,
he gave me the name of a lady of quality at Paris, desiring
me, if in difficulty, to apply to him through her; but that
was, if in difficulty in France; of course, she could do nothing
for me in this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you the name of the lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;it is on the first leaf of my pocket-book.
Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest read the name, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must write immediately a few words, acquainting her
with your position. I will see the letter safely delivered before
the week is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good can she possibly do me?&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say; but this I know, that if any thing is to be
done, it will be. Write immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
The priest called the gaoler, and requested writing materials,
which were brought, and in a few minutes I had done as he requested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Sir, I have written to please you; but I candidly
state that I consider it a useless attempt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were I of your opinion, I should not have advised you to
write,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;There are wheels within wheels that you
have no conception of, in these troubled times. What I most
fear is, that it may arrive too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest took his leave of me, and I was left to my own
thoughts. When I considered that the address of this lady had
been given to me by the very man whom they were so anxious to
secure as a traitor, I at once decided that no benefit could arrive
from any interference on her part; and I therefore, after a quarter
of an hour, dismissed the whole subject from my thoughts, and
commenced my reading of the sacred writings. The following
morning, when the gaoler came in, I could not help observing
to him, that as I had been condemned so many days, I felt much
surprise at the delay of my execution. His reply was, that he
heard that others were in custody upon the same charge, and that
they waited for their convictions that we might all suffer at the
same time; for the order for my execution had come on the Friday
last, but had been countermanded on the afternoon of the same
day. Although this satisfied me that I had no hopes of escape, yet
I was pleased that I had obtained more time for preparation, and
I renewed my reading with ardour. Another week passed, when
the gaoler, with a solemn face, and much apparent concern, came
in, and informed me that the other parties arrested had been tried
before the Commission, and had been condemned, and that it
was expected that the execution would take place either on the
morrow or the day after. The announcement did not affect me
much. I had made up my mind that I should suffer, and had to
a degree weaned myself from life. I considered how all hopes of
my ever enjoying the delight of family and kindred ties had flown
away, and I looked with disgust upon my career as a privateer&rsquo;s-man&mdash;a
career of recklessness and blood, so denounced by the
sacred writings which I had before me. I reflected that if I were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
to leave the prison, I should have no other means of sustenance,
and should probably return to my former life, and load my soul
with a still heavier weight of crime, and, although I felt an occasional
bitter pang at the idea of leaving the world so young&mdash;a
world which I could not hate&mdash;still I was, after a few hours&rsquo;
communing and reflection, resigned to my fate, and exclaimed
with sincerity, &ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo; I think, Madam, you may
have observed that, sinful as I was, my whole career proved that I
was not a hardened sinner. Good was not driven entirely out of
me, but was latent, notwithstanding all my excesses, and the bad
company which had influenced me.</p>

<p>I now prayed, and prayed earnestly, and I thought that my
prayers were heard. Such was my state of mind on the day before
the one appointed for my execution, when the gaoler and one of
the sheriff&rsquo;s officers came into my cell, accompanied by the Roman
Catholic priest whom I have before mentioned. I perceived by
the countenance of the gaoler, who was a humane man, that he
had no unpleasant news. The sheriff&rsquo;s officer delivered to him an
order for my liberation, and to my astonishment I was told by the
gaoler that my pardon was signed, and that I was free. I was
stupified with the intelligence, and I stood without making any
reply. The priest waved his hand to them as a hint to leave the
room, which they both did. As they left, my eyes followed them,
and then I cast them down upon the Bible which lay before me on
the table, and slipping down from the bench upon my knees, I
covered up my face and prayed. My prayers were confused&mdash;I
hardly knew what I said&mdash;but I knew that they were intended to
be grateful to Heaven for my unexpected preservation from an
ignominious death. After a time, I rose up, and perceived the
priest, whose presence I had till then forgotten. He had been
kneeling at the other side of the table praying with me, and I am
sure for me&mdash;and he was rising up just after I had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust, Captain Elrington,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, &ldquo;that
the peril you have been in will influence your future life; and that
this severe trial will not be thrown away upon you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust not, Sir,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;I feel that it has been good for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
me to have been afflicted. I believe that I have been indebted to
your exertions for my deliverance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No further than having seen your letter duly and speedily
delivered. I could do no more, for with all will, I have no power;
and that was little to do for one who so generously assisted our
friends in their distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I then to believe that I am indebted to the interest of
a French lady, residing at the court of Versailles, for my deliverance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so&mdash;this may appear strange to you, Captain Elrington,
but such is the case. Understand, that in these troubled times,
the ruling monarch of this country cannot distinguish his friends
from his enemies. He can only trust to professions, and they are
not always sincere. There are many in the council at this time,
who, if the Pretender, as he is called, had succeeded, would long
before this have joined him, and who had wished him success,
although they dared not venture to assist him. The interest of
the lady in question with these people has prevailed over the true
adherents of the Hanoverian king, and thus through this lady
have you obtained your release. I state this to you in confidence;
to publish what I have told you would be to betray your friends.
Can I be of any further service to you? for you can leave your
prison as soon as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None, I thank you, good Sir,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I have money
more than sufficient to reward my gaoler, and to defray my expenses
to Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my best thanks and sincere wishes for your happiness.
Then I will not intrude upon you any more, except to
give you my address in case of need. You have made warm
friends by your conduct, and if you ever require their assistance,
it will not be withheld.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest gave his address upon a piece of paper, and then
came to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our creeds are not exactly the same, but you will not, my
son, refuse my blessing?&rdquo; said he, putting his hand upon my
head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said I, dropping on my knees, &ldquo;I receive it all
in thankfulness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God bless you, my son,&rdquo; said he, with emotion&mdash;and
he then quitted the cell.</p>

<p>What with the previous excitement when my liberation was
announced, and the parting with the kind priest, my feelings
were so powerful, that, as soon as I was alone, I gave vent to
them in a flood of tears. As soon as I was more composed, I
rose from the bench, put my necessaries into my valise, and
summoned the gaoler, to whom I made a handsome present,
thanking him for his kindness during my incarceration. I then
shook hands with him, fee&rsquo;d the turnkey who had attended upon
me, and in a minute more I was clear of the Tower gates. How
my heart heaved when I was once more in the open air.</p>

<p>I looked around me, and perceived that many men were busy
in erecting a scaffolding. My heart sank as I beheld them, as I
felt certain what it was for; but to verify my opinion, I turned to
an old woman who had a sort of stall from which she dispensed
mead to the populace, and inquired of her for what the scaffold
was being erected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the men who are to be executed to-morrow for
aiding the Jacobites to escape,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your worship
take a glass of mead this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not thirsty,&rdquo; I replied, as I walked hastily away with
my valise upon my shoulders.</p>

<p>A stranger to this part of London, I hardly knew where to
direct my steps; I walked past the square before the Tower, until
I came into a street called Catherine-street, where a tavern met
my view, and into it I entered immediately, glad, as it were, to
hide myself, for I felt as if all the world looked upon me as a
person just discharged from prison. I obtained good entertainment
there, and slept there that night. The next morning,
the host having provided me two good horses, and a youngster to
take them back, I set off for Liverpool, and after five days&rsquo; travel
without adventure, I arrived at the town, and proceeded direct
to the house of Mr. Trevannion, my owner. I took my valise off
the boy&rsquo;s horse, and having paid him for his attendance, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
knocked at the door, for it was late in the evening, and dark,
when I arrived. The door (for it was at his private house door,
which was next to the counting-house door, that I knocked) was
opened; and the woman who opened it shrieked, and let drop
the candle, exclaiming, &ldquo;Help, oh God&mdash;a ghost, a ghost!&rdquo;
for it appeared that the news had arrived at Liverpool from a messenger
who had been sent express after I had been condemned,
stating that there was no hope, and that I was to suffer on the
Monday previous; and this was the Saturday evening on which I
had arrived. Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s clerk hearing a noise in the
passage, came out with another candle, and seeing me, and the
woman lying on the floor in a swoon, stared, staggered to the
door of the room where his master was sitting, and the door
being a-jar, he fell back with great force into the room, dropping
under the table between Mr. Trevannion and Captain Levee,
who was sitting with him, smoking, as was very often their wont.
This brought out Captain Levee with one of the table-candlesticks,
who, upon seeing me, ran to me, and embracing me
warmly, cried out, as the clerk made his escape&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is Elrington alive and well, Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this announcement Mr. Trevannion came out, and threw
himself into my arms, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank God for all his mercies, but above all, that I have
not been the cause of your death, my dear Elrington. Come in,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, in a faultering voice; and as soon as he gained his
seat, he laid his head down and sobbed with excitement and joy.</p>

<p>I followed Captain Levee into the room, and was taking a
chair, when I perceived there was another person present besides
Captain Levee and Mr. Trevannion, which was the daughter
of the latter; that is, I presumed as much, for I knew that he
was a widower, and had one daughter living, out of a family of
three children. She appeared to be about seventeen years of age,
and had just come from a Protestant convent, as they called
establishments where young women were educated at Chester.
Mr. Trevannion was still with his face covered, and not yet recovered
from his burst of feeling, when this young gentlewoman
came up to me, and said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
&ldquo;Captain Elrington, you have behaved nobly to my father;
accept my hand and my friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was so dazzled from coming out of the dark, and so excited
from what had just passed, that I was almost bewildered; but I
accepted the offered hand, and bowed over it, although I declare
that at the time I could not distinguish her features, although I
perceived that her person was slight and elegant. As she retreated
to her seat, Mr. Trevannion, who had recovered from his
emotion, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that, at this moment, your head was exhibited
over the gates of Temple-bar. The idea, as Captain Levee will
tell you, has haunted me; for I felt, and should always have
felt, that I was the cause of your death. God bless you, my dear
Sir, and may I have an opportunity of showing you my gratitude
and regard for your noble conduct towards me, and the sacrifice
which you would have made. You need not tell me, for I know
too well, that you took all the onus and blame of the affair upon
your own shoulders, and preferred death to impeaching me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Elrington,&rdquo; said Captain Levee, &ldquo;I told our crew,
and you have proved me a true prophet, that you never would
peach, but die game. We were talking of you, supposing you
dead, when you came in. I must tell you, that more than once
Mr. Trevannion had made up his mind to deliver himself up,
and acknowledge the truth, but I prevented him, as it would have
been a useless sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did; but, nevertheless, it was so heavy on my conscience,
that had it not been for your perseverance, and the
thoughts of leaving my poor girl here an orphan in the world, I
certainly should have so done, for I felt life to be a burden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad that you did not, Sir,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;my life
is of little value; I have no one to support, no one to love, and
no one to lament me if I fall. A shot from the enemy may soon
send me out of the world, and there will only be a man the less
in it, as far as people are interested about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not the case now, at all events,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion;
&ldquo;but pray, tell us how it is that you have escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have not escaped,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;here is my pardon, with
the sign-manual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how was it obtained?&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Levee; &ldquo;all
intercession made through some of the strongest friends of the
government was in vain, that I can assert; for you must not
suppose that we have been idle down here. We did not leave
London till after you were condemned, and every entreaty to see
you, or to communicate by letter, was denied to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had better, then, begin at the beginning, and state all
that occurred. I will first thank you, my dear Levee, for your
kind assistance, which I would not avail myself of, as I calculated
(wrongly I own) that it would be wiser to remain a prisoner;
and I considered that my very refusal to escape would be
admitted by the government as a proof of my innocence. I did
not know that I had to deal with such malignant people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then commenced my narrative, which occupied the remainder
of the evening, and, having received their congratulations,
we had a pipe or two, and, as I was fatigued, we retired
to bed. I slept little on this, I may say, first night of rest and
quiet, after my liberation. I was happy, and yet perplexed.
During the time of my imprisonment, it had occurred to me that
the life of a privateer&rsquo;s-man was not one which I could follow up
with a good conscience; and I had, on my journey down to
Liverpool, made up my mind that I would give it up. I knew
this might annoy Mr. Trevannion, and that I should have to meet
with the ridicule of Captain Levee, and I was thinking whether it
were possible, in the first place, that I could give some well-grounded
excuse; and, in the next, what other means of gaining
my livelihood I could substitute in its stead. My restlessness
induced me to get up earlier than usual, and I went out for an
hour&rsquo;s walk upon the wharfs. I saw my little schooner riding on
the stream, and, as she gently rose, and dipped to the swell
which ran in with the tide, she looked so beautiful that my resolutions
were already giving way. I would look at her no longer;
so I turned from the river, and walked back to the owner&rsquo;s house.
It was still early when I went into the eating-hall, where I found
Miss Trevannion alone.</p>

<div class="chaphead"><p>I state my newly-awakened scruples as to the lawfulness of a Privateer&rsquo;s-man&rsquo;s
Life to Mr. Trevannion, but nevertheless undertake another
Cruise&mdash;Save a Youth from drowning, who he proves to be&mdash;Conflict
with a French Privateer&mdash;Take her and deliver a Prize&mdash;Return

<p>Miss Trevannion, my dear Madam, was taller than your sex
usually are, her figure slight, and still unformed to a certain
degree, but promising perfection. Her hair was very dark, her
features regular and handsome, her complexion very pale, and
her skin fair as the snow. As she stood in silence, she reminded
you of a classical antique statue, and hardly appeared
to breathe through her delicate lips, but when she was animated
with conversation, it almost reminded you of the Promethean
fire which poets state was stolen from Heaven to animate
a piece of marble. Then the colour came in her cheeks, intelligence
played on her countenance, and every thing which at
first sight appeared wanting, was, like magic, found to light up
her face. Her smiles were the sweetest I ever beheld, and one
of those smiles she bestowed upon me as I entered the room and
paid her my obeisance. The night before, I had not observed
her much, I was too busy with her father and Captain Levee, and
she sat remote from the table and distant from the light, and she
never spoke but when she took my hand and thanked me, as I
mentioned before. I thought then that her voice was like a silver
bell, but made no other remark upon her. We had, however,
exchanged but few words before her father came in, accompanied
by Captain Levee, and we sat down to our morning&rsquo;s repast
of chocolate.</p>

<p>After we had broken our fast, Captain Levee hastened away
on board of his vessel. My imprisonment had detained him from
sailing, and Mr. Trevannion was anxious that he should be off as
soon as possible to make up for lost time, as the expenses of the
vessel were heavy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell, Elrington, for the present,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
come to you on board of your schooner some time during the
day.&rdquo; When Captain Levee was gone&mdash;for, to tell the truth, I
was afraid of his ridicule&mdash;I thought it a good opportunity to
give my thoughts to my owner, and as I had nothing to say, which
his daughter might not hear, I began as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trevannion, I think it right to state to you that during
my imprisonment a great change has come over my feelings upon
certain points. I am not ashamed to acknowledge that it has been
occasioned by the death which stared me in the face, and from
my having seriously communed with myself, and examined,
more than I perhaps have done during the whole of my former
life, the sacred writings which are given us as our guide. The
point to which I refer is, that I have come to a conviction that
privateering is not a lawful or honourable profession, and with
these feelings I should wish to resign the command of the schooner
which you have had the kindness to give me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Elrington,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion. &ldquo;Well, I
should not have thought to have heard this from you I confess.
Much as I respect your scruples, you are too scrupulous. I can
hardly imagine that you have turned to the sect of the Quakers,
and think fighting is contrary to the Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir, not so far as that. I consider war, as a profession,
both necessary and honourable, and a nation is bound to be prepared
for any foreign attack, and to act upon the defensive, or
on the offensive, if it is necessary. It is not that. I do not consider
the soldier who fights for his country is not doing his duty,
nor the seamen who are employed by the state are not equally justified
in their profession. What I refer to is privateering. That is,
vessels fitted out for the purpose of aggression by private merchants,
and merely for the sake of profit. They are not fitted out
with any patriotic motives, but merely for gain. They are speculations
in which the lives of people on both sides are sacrificed
for the sake of lucre&mdash;and had you witnessed such scenes of
bloodshed and cruelty as I have during my career, such dreadful
passions let loose, and defying all restraint, you would agree
with me, that he who leads such miscreants to their quarry has
much to answer for. Were it possible to control the men on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
board of a privateer as the men are controlled in the king&rsquo;s service,
it might be more excusable; but manned as privateers always
will be, with the most reckless characters, when once they
are roused by opposition, stimulated by the sight of plunder, or
drunken with victory, no power on earth can restrain their barbarity
and vengeance, and a captain of a privateer who attempted,
would, in most cases, if he stood between them and their will,
unless he were supported, fall a victim to his rashness. All this
I have seen; and all I now express I have long felt, even when
younger and more thoughtless. You know that I did give up privateering
at one time, because I was shocked at the excesses to
which I was a party. Since that, I have accepted the command
of a vessel, for the idea of being captain was too flattering to my
vanity to permit me to refuse; but reflection has again decided
me not to engage in it further. I hope this communication will
not displease you, Mr. Trevannion. If I am wrong in my opinion,
at all events I am sincere, for I am giving up my only
source of livelihood from a sense of duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that you are sincere, Elrington,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion,
&ldquo;but at the same time I think that you are much too
strait-laced in your opinions. When nations are at war, they
mutually do all the mischief that they can to each other, and I
cannot see what difference there is between my fitting out a privateer
under the king&rsquo;s authority, or the king having vessels and
men for the national service. The government fit out all the vessels
that they can, and when their own funds are exhausted, they
encourage individuals to employ their capital in adding to the
means of distressing the enemy. If I had property on the high
seas, would it be respected any more than other English property
by the enemy? Certainly not; and, therefore, I am not bound
to respect theirs. The end of war is to obtain an honourable
peace; and the more the enemy is distressed, the sooner are you
likely to obtain one. I do not, therefore, consider that privateering
is worse than any other species of warfare, or that the
privateer&rsquo;s-man is a whit more reckless or brutal than soldiers or
men-of-war&rsquo;s men in the hour of victory in the king&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is this difference, Sir,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;first, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
officers commanding; although glad to obtain prize-money, they
are stimulated by nobler feelings as well. They look to honour
and distinction; they have the feeling that they are defending
their king and country, to support them and throw a halo on their
exertions; and they have such control over their men, that,
although I admit they are equally inclined to excess as the
privateer&rsquo;s-man, they are held in check by the authority which
they dare not resist. Now, Mr. Trevannion, privateer&rsquo;s-men
seek not honour, and are not stimulated by a desire to serve
the country; all they look to is how to obtain the property of
others under sanction; and could they without any risk do so,
they would care little whether it was English property or not,
provided that they put the money into their pockets. If I held
this opinion as a seaman on board of a privateer, what must I
feel now, when I am the leader of such people, and the responsibility
of their acts is thrown upon my shoulders, for such I feel
is the case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion, &ldquo;that we had better not
discuss this question any further just now. Of course you must
decide for yourself; but I have this favour to ask of you. Trusting
to your resuming the command of the vessel, I have no one to replace
you at present, and I hope you will not refuse to take the
command of her for one more cruise: should you, on your return
and on mature reflection, be of the same opinion as you are now,
I certainly shall no longer press you to remain, and will do all I
can to assist you in any other views you may have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To that, Sir, I can have no objection,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;it
would be unfair of me to leave you without a captain to the vessel,
and I am therefore ready to sail in her as soon as you please, upon
the understanding that I may quit her, if I am of the same opinion
as I am now, upon my return to port.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, my dear Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion, rising,
&ldquo;that is all I request. I must now go to the counting-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he left the room, but his countenance showed
that he was far from pleased.</p>

<p>Miss Trevannion, who had been a silent listener to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
conversation, as soon as her father had closed the door after him,
thus spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Elrington, the opinion of a young maiden like me
can be of little value, but you know not how much pleasure you
have given me by the sentiments you have expressed. Alas! that
a man so good, so generous, and so feeling in every other respect,
should be led away by the desire of gain, to be the owner
of such a description of property. But in this town, wealth is
every thing; the way by which it is obtained is not thought of.
My father&rsquo;s father left him a large property in vessels employed
wholly in the slave-trade, and it was through the persuasions of
my poor mother, that my father was induced to give up that nefarious
traffic. Since that, his capital has been chiefly employed
in privateering, which, if not so brutal and disgraceful, is certainly
nearly as demoralizing. I have been home but a short
time, and I have already ventured to express my opinion, certainly
not so forcibly and so well as you have, upon the subject;
but I was laughed at as a tender-hearted girl, who could not be a
fit judge of such matters. But now that you, a captain of one of
his vessels, have expressed your dislike to the profession, I think
some good may arise. If my father were a poor man, it would be
more excusable, if excuse there can be, but such is not the case.
He is wealthy, and to whom has he to leave his wealth but to me,
his only child? Captain Elrington, you are right&mdash;be firm&mdash;my
father&rsquo;s obligations to you are very great, and your opinion will
have its influence. I am his daughter&mdash;his only daughter&mdash;his
love for me is great, I know, and I also have my power over him.
Supported as I have been by you, I will now exert it to the utmost
to persuade him to retire from further employment of his means
in such a speculation. I thanked you yesterday, when I first
saw you, for your noble behaviour, I little thought that I should
have again, in so short a time, to express my thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Trevannion did not wait for any reply from me, but then
quitted the room.</p>

<p>I must say, that although so young a person, I was much
pleased at Miss Trevannion&rsquo;s approval of my sentiments. She
appeared, from the very short acquaintance I had had with her,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
to be a person of a firm and decided disposition, and very different
from the insipid class of females generally met with. Her
approval strengthened my resolution; still, as I had promised
her father that I would go another cruise in the privateer, I left
the house and went on board to resume the command. My return
was joyfully hailed by the officers and men, which is not always
the case. I found her, as may be supposed, ready for sea
at a minute&rsquo;s warning, so that I had nothing to do but to embark
my effects, which I did before the noon was passed, and then
went on shore to Mr. Trevannion, to receive his orders. I found
him with Captain Levee in the back room; and I told Mr. Trevannion
that I had resumed the command, and was ready to sail
as soon as he pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must make up for lost time, Elrington,&rdquo; replied he;
&ldquo;I have ordered Captain Levee to cruise to the northward of the
Western Isles, occasionally working up as far as the Scilly Isles.
Now, I think, you had better take your ground in the Channel,
between Dunkirk and Calais. There is as much to be made by
salvage in recapturing English vessels in that quarter, as there is
in taking the enemy&rsquo;s vessels; and I am sure,&rdquo; added Mr. Trevannion,
smiling, &ldquo;you will think that legitimate warfare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Captain Levee laughed, and said, &ldquo;I have been told
what you said to Mr. Trevannion, Elrington. I said that it was
the effects of being condemned for high treason, and would wear
off in a three-months&rsquo; cruise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good impressions do wear off very soon, I fear,&rdquo; replied I;
&ldquo;but I hope that it will not be the case in this instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see, my good fellow,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee;
&ldquo;for my part I hope they will, for otherwise we shall lose the best
privateer&rsquo;s-man I ever fell in with. However, it&rsquo;s no use bringing
up the question now, let us wait till our cruises are over, and we
meet again. Good-bye, Elrington, and may you be fortunate.
My anchor is short stay apeak, and I shall be under sail in half
an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Levee sailed at the time that he mentioned; I remained
at anchor till the next morning, and then once more was
running down the Irish Channel before a stiff breeze. I forgot to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
mention that while at Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s I had looked at the address
of the Catholic priest who had announced to me my release
from prison, and had left copies of it, as well as of that of the
lady at Paris, in the care of Mr. Trevannion. It was now cold,
autumnal weather, and the Channel was but rough sailing-ground.
During the first fortnight we were fortunate enough to
make two recaptures of considerable value, which arrived safely
in the Thames, after which we had a succession of gales front the
southward, it being the time of the equinox, which drove us close
to the sands of Yarmouth, and we even had difficulty in clearing
them and getting into sea-room by standing to the eastward. The
weather still continued very bad, and we were lying-to under storm
sails for several days, and at last found ourselves a degree and a
half to the northward, off the coast of Norfolk, when the weather
moderated, and the wind changed to the northward. It was a
fine clear night, but with no moon, and we were running before
the wind to regain our cruising-ground; but the wind again
shifted and baffled us, and at last it fell light, and, being on a
wind, we did not make more than four miles an hour, although
there was very little sea. About one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I
had gone on deck, and was walking to and fro with the first officer,
Mr. James, when I thought that I heard a faint hallo from
to windward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;silence there forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I listened, and thought that I heard the cry again. &ldquo;Mr.
James,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;did you not hear some one shout?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, then, and listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did so, but I could not hear it repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain that I heard a voice as if on the waters,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Perhaps some one has fallen overboard. Turn the hands up to
muster, and haul the fore-sheet to windward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men were mustered, but no one was missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was your fancy, Sir,&rdquo; observed the first officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but I am still in my own
mind persuaded that such was the case. Perhaps I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
&ldquo;Shall we let draw the fore-sheet, Sir?&rdquo; said Mr. James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we may as well; but the wind is lighter than it was.
I think we shall have a calm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be as much as she can do to stem the tide and hold
her own,&rdquo; observed Mr. James. &ldquo;Let draw the fore-sheet,
my lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow or another I had a feeling which I could not surmount,
that I certainly had heard a faint shout, and although
admitting such to be the case, there was little chance of being of
service to any one, I felt a reluctance to leave the spot, and as I
walked the deck silent and alone, this feeling became insurmountable.</p>

<p>I remained on deck till the tide turned, and then, instead of
taking advantage of it so as to gain to the southward, I put the
schooner&rsquo;s head the other way, so as to keep as near as I could
to the spot where I heard the voice, reducing her sail so as just to
stem the tide. I cannot now account for my anxiety, which, under
the circumstances, I most certainly never should have felt,
unless it was that Providence was pleased to interpose on this
occasion more directly than usual. I could not leave the deck;
I waited for daylight with great impatience, and as the day
dawned I had my telescope in my hand looking round the
compass.</p>

<p>At last, as the sun rose from the fog on the horizon, something
attracted my eye, and I made it out to be the two masts of a
vessel which had sunk in about six fathoms water. Still I could
see nothing except the masts. However, to make sure, I made
sail on the schooner, and stood towards them. A short tack
enabled us to fetch, and in half an hour we passed the wreck
about a half-musket-shot to windward, when we perceived an arm
lifted up out of the water, and waved to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is somebody there,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I was right.
Quickly, my lads; fore-sheet to windward, and lower down the
stern-boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done in a minute, and in a short time the boat
returned, bringing with them a lad about sixteen years old, whom
they had found in the water, clinging to the masts of the vessel.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
He was too much exhausted to speak or move. He was put into
bed, covered up with blankets, and some warm spirits and water
poured down his throat. We then hoisted up the boat, and made
sail upon the schooner, and I went down below to breakfast,
rejoicing that I had acted upon the impulse which I had felt, and
had thus been instrumental in saving the life of a fellow-creature.
A few minutes after he was put into bed, the lad fell into a sound
sleep, which continued during the whole of the day. The next
morning he awoke greatly recovered, and very hungry, and as
soon as he had eaten he rose and dressed himself.</p>

<p>I then sent for him, as I was impatient to see him and learn
his history. When he entered the cabin, it struck me I had seen
his features before, but where I could not say. To my inquiries
he stated that the brig was the Jane and Mary, of Hull, laden
with coals; that they had started a wooden end during the gale,
and that she had filled so rapidly that they got the boat from off
the boom to save their lives, but from the heavy sea running, and
the confusion, the boat had been bilged against the bulwarks,
and went down as they were shoving off; that he had supported
himself by one of the oars, and was soon separated from his companions
who floated around him; that during this time the brig
had sunk, and he, clinging to the oar, had been drawn towards
her as she sank, and carried some feet under water. On his
rising he perceived the top-gallant masts above water, and had
made for them, and on looking round he could not see any of the
rest of the crew, who must have all perished; that he had been
two days on the mast, and was perished with cold. Finding that
his feet, which hung down on the water, were much warmer than
the other portions of his body exposed to the wind, he had sunk
himself down in the water, and remained there, and had he not
done so, he must have perished.</p>

<p>I asked him how long he had been at sea, and he said he had
only gone one voyage, and had been but three months on board.
There was something in his manner so superior to the condition
of apprentice (which he stated himself to be) on board of such a
vessel; and I felt such an interest, which I could not account
for, towards the lad, that I then asked who were his friends. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
replied, stammering, that he had not a friend in the world except
a brother older than himself by many years, and he did not know
where he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your father&rsquo;s name? Is he alive, and who is he? You
must tell me that, or I shall not know where to send you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth was very confused, and would not give me any
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my lad,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think as I have saved your life,
I deserve a little confidence, and it shall not be misplaced. I
perceive that you have not been brought up as a lad for the sea,
and you must therefore trust me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, Sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if you will not send me back to
my father and&mdash;mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not against your will, my good lad,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;although I shall probably persuade you all I can to return to
them. I presume you ran away from your home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, I did,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;for I could not possibly
stay there any longer, and my brother did so before me, for the
same reason that I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I promise you, if you will confide in me, that I will
not force your inclinations, so now tell me who are your father
and mother, and why you left home. You want a friend now,
and without confidence you cannot expect friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you all, Sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for I see by your face
that you will not take advantage of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then commenced, and you may imagine my surprise, my
dear Madam, when I found that it was my own brother Philip,
whom I had left a child of ten years old, who was addressing me.
He had, as he had asserted, left his home and thrown himself on
the wide world for the same reason which I had; for his spirit,
like mine, could not brook the treatment which he received. I
allowed him to finish his narrative, and then made myself known
to him.</p>

<p>You may imagine the scene, and the delight of the poor fellow,
who, as he encircled me in his arms, clinging to me with the
tears of joy on his cheeks, told me that his great object had been
to find me out, and that although he had no idea what had become
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
of me, he thought it most likely that I had taken to a seafaring
life.</p>

<p>I now felt certain that Providence had specially interposed in
this business, and had, for its own good reasons, created those
unusual feelings of interest which I described to you, that I
might be the saviour of my brother; and most grateful was I, I
can assure you. I had now a companion and friend, one to love
and to cherish. I was no longer alone in the world, and I do not
know when I had felt so happy for a long while.</p>

<p>I left my brother below in the cabin, and went on deck to
acquaint the officers with this strange meeting. The intelligence
soon ran through the vessel, and of course the poor shipwrecked
boy became an object of unusual interest. That whole day I was
interrogating and receiving intelligence from him relative to our
family. I made him describe his sisters and every member of it,
even the servants and our neighbours were not forgotten, and for
the first time since I had quitted home, I knew what had occurred
during the six years of my absence. From the accounts he gave
me, I certainly had no inclination ever to return as long as certain
parties were in existence; and my brother declared that nothing
but force should ever induce him. The more I talked with him,
the more I was pleased with him. He appeared of a frank, noble
disposition, full of honour and high sentiments, winning in his
manners, and mirthful to excess. Indeed his handsome countenance
implied and expressed as much, and it did not deceive.</p>

<p>I hardly need say that he took up his quarters in my cabin,
and having procured for him more suitable apparel, he looked
what he was, the perfect young gentleman. He was soon a general
favourite on board, not only with the officers but with the
men. One would have thought that the danger and distress we
had found him in would have sickened him for the sea for ever;
but it was quite the contrary. He delighted in his profession,
and was certainly born to be a sailor. I asked him what he felt
when he had remained so long clinging to the mast; if he had not
given up all hopes of being saved? and he replied no, that he had
not; that he did not know how long he might have had to remain
there, but that he had never abandoned the idea of being taken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
off by some vessel or another, and that he thought that he might
have continued there for twenty-four hours longer without being
exhausted, as after he had sunk himself into the water he felt
warm, and no exertion was necessary. It is of such buoyant
spirits as these, Madam, that seamen should be made.</p>

<p>You cannot have an idea of the pleasure which I experienced
at this falling in with my brother Philip. It appeared to have
given a new stimulus to my existence; even privateering did not
appear so hateful to me, after I had heard him express his delight
at being likely to be so employed, for such he stated had long
been his ardent wish. Two days afterwards we had regained
our cruising-ground, and perceived a French privateer steering
for the port of Calais, in company with a large merchant vessel
which she had captured. The wind was light, and we discovered
her at daybreak, just as the fog cleared away, she being then
about mid-channel, and not more than five miles distant. We
made all sail, and soon were within gun-shot. The Frenchman
appeared determined not to part with his prize without a trial of
strength, but as the captured vessel was the nearest to us, I decided
to retake her first, and then fight him if he wished. I therefore
steered to lay the prize by the board. The Frenchman, a
lugger of twelve guns, perceiving our intention, made also for
the prize to defend her, he steering up for her close-hauled, we
running down to her free, the prize lying between us, and sheltering
each of us from the other&rsquo;s guns. It is difficult to say
whether the Frenchman or we were the first to touch her sides
with our respective vessels; I rather think that the Frenchman
was a second or two before us. At all events they were quicker
than we were, and were on the deck first, besides having the advantage
of the assistance of their men already on board, so that
we were taken at a great disadvantage. However, we did gain
the deck by boarding at two points, forward and aft, and a fierce
contest ensued. The French were more numerous than we were,
but my men were better selected, being all very powerful, athletic
fellows. Philip had boarded with the other party forward, which
was led by my chief officer. My party, who were abaft, not being
so numerous, were beaten back to the taffrail of the vessel, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
we stood at bay, defending ourselves against the furious assaults
of the Frenchmen. But if we lost, the other party gained, for
the whole body of the Frenchmen were between us and them, and
those who faced Philip&rsquo;s party were driven back to abaft the
mainmast. It so happened that Philip was thrown down on the
deck, and his men passed over him; and while in that position,
and unable to rise from the pressure upon him, he heard a calling
out from below: this told him that the English prisoners were in
the hold; and as soon as he could rise he threw off the hatches,
and they rushed up, to the number of twenty-three stout fellows,
to our support, cheering most manfully, and by their cheers announcing
to the French that we had received assistance. This
gave fresh courage to my men, who were hard pressed and faint
with their great exertion. We cheered, and rushed upon the
enemy, who were already weakened by many of them having
turned round to resist the increased impetus from forward. Our
cheers were replied to by Philip&rsquo;s party and the prisoners, and
the French were losing the day. They made another desperate
rush upon Philip&rsquo;s men, and succeeded in driving them back to
before the main-hatches; but what they gained forward, they lost
abaft, as we pushed on with vigour. This was their last attempt.
The main-hatch being open, several of them in the confusion fell
into it, others followed them of their own accord, and at last
every one of them was beaten down from the deck, and the
hatches were put over them, with three cheers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, for the privateer&mdash;she is our own,&rdquo; cried Philip;
&ldquo;follow me, my men,&rdquo; continued he, as he sprang upon the bulwarks
of the prize, and from thence into the main rigging of the
lugger alongside.</p>

<p>Most of my men followed him; and as there were but few men
left on board of the lugger, she was soon in our possession, and
thus we had both the enemy and the prize without firing a cannon-shot.
It was strange that this combat between two privateers
should thus be decided upon the deck of another vessel, but such
was the fact. We had several men badly wounded, but not one
killed. The French were not quite so fortunate, as seven of their
men lay dead upon the decks. The prize proved to be the Antelope
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
West-Indiaman, laden with sugar and rum, and of considerable
value. We gave her up to the captain and crew, who
had afforded us such timely assistance, and they were not a little
pleased at being thus rescued from a French prison. The privateer
was named the Jean Bart, of twelve guns, and one hundred
and fifteen men, some away in prizes. She was a new vessel,
and this her first cruise. As it required many men to man her,
and we had the prisoners to incumber us, I resolved that I would
take her to Liverpool at once; and six days afterwards we arrived
there without further adventure. Philip&rsquo;s gallant conduct had
won him great favour with my officers and men, and I must say
that I felt very proud of him.</p>

<p>As soon as we had anchored both vessels, I went on shore
with Philip to Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s, to give him an account of what
had occurred during the short cruise, and I hardly need say that
he was satisfied with the results, as we had made three recaptures
of value besides a privateer. I introduced Philip to him, acquainting
him with his miraculous preservation, and Mr. Trevannion
very kindly invited him for the present to remain in his
house. We then took our leave, promising to be back by dinner-time,
and I went with Philip to fit him out in a more creditable
way; and having made my purchases and given my orders (it
being then almost two o&rsquo;clock <i>post meridiem</i>), we hastened to
Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s, that we might be in time for dinner. I was,
I must confess, anxious to see Miss Trevannion, for she had
often occupied my thoughts during the cruise. She met me with
great friendliness and welcomed me back. Our dinner was very
agreeable, and Philip&rsquo;s sallies were much approved of. He was,
indeed, a mirthful, witty lad, full of jest and humour, and with
a good presence withal. Mr. Trevannion being called out just as
dinner was finished. Miss Trevannion observed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume, Mr. Elrington, that your good fortune and the
reputation you have acquired in so short a time, have put an end
to all your misgivings as to a privateer&rsquo;s-man&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite so light and inconstant, Miss Trevannion,&rdquo;
replied I; &ldquo;I rejoice that in this cruise I have really nothing to
lament or blush for, and trust at the same time we have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
serviceable to our country; but my opinion is the same, and I
certainly wish that I had fought under the king&rsquo;s pennant instead
of on board of a privateer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are, then, of the same mind, and intend to resign the
command?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Miss Trevannion, although I admit that this lad&rsquo;s
welfare makes it more important than ever that I should have
some means of livelihood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rejoice to hear you speak thus, Mr. Elrington, and I think
my father&rsquo;s obligations to you are such, that if he does not assist
you, I should feel ashamed of him&mdash;but such I am certain will
not be the case. He will forward your views, whatever they may
be, to the utmost of his power&mdash;at the same time, I admit,
from conversations I have had with him, that he will be mortified
at your resigning the command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so shall I,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;for I do not agree with you
or my brother: I see no more harm in privateering than in any
other fighting. I suppose, Miss Trevannion, you have been the
cause of my brother&rsquo;s scruples, and I tell you candidly to your
face, that I do not thank you for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Trevannion coloured up at this remark, and then replied,
&ldquo;I do not think, Mr. Philip, that I have had the pleasure
of seeing your brother more than three times in my life, and that
within these last six weeks, and sure I am that we have not had a
quarter of an hour&rsquo;s conversation altogether. It is, therefore,
assuredly, too much to say that I am the cause, and your brother
will tell you that he expressed these opinions before I ever had
had any conversation with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; replied Philip, &ldquo;but you approved of his
sentiments, and that concluded the business, I am sure, and I
don&rsquo;t wonder at it. I only hope that you won&rsquo;t ask me to do any
thing I do not wish to do; for I am sure that I could never refuse
you any thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so, Mr. Philip; for if I see you do
that which I think wrong, I shall certainly try my influence over
you,&rdquo; replied Miss Trevannion, smiling. &ldquo;I really was not
aware that I had such power.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
Here Mr. Trevannion came in again, and the conversation
was changed; and shortly afterwards Miss Trevannion left the
room. Philip, who was tired of sitting while Mr. Trevannion
and I took our pipes, and who was anxious to see the town, also
left us; and I then stated to Mr. Trevannion that having now
completed the cruise which I had agreed that I would, I wished
to know whether he had provided himself with another captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you appear so determined, my dear Elrington, I will
only say that I am very sorry, and will not urge the matter any
longer. My daughter told me since your absence that she was
certain that you would adhere to your resolution; and, although
I hoped the contrary, yet I have been considering in which way I
can serve you. It is not only my pleasure, but my duty so to do;
I have not forgotten, and never will forget, that you in all probability
saved my life by your self-devotion in the affair of the Jacobites.
When you first came to me, you were recommended as a
good accountant, and, to a certain degree, a man of business;
and, at all events, you proved yourself well acquainted and apt
at figures. Do you think that a situation on shore would suit
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should endeavour to give satisfaction, Sir,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;but I fear that I should have much to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you would; but I reply that you would soon learn.
Now, Elrington, what I have to say to you is this: I am getting
old, and in a few years shall be past work; and I think I should
like you as an assistant for the present, and a successor hereafter.
If you would like to join me, you shall superintend the
more active portion of the business; and I have no doubt but that
in a year or two you will be master of the whole. As you know,
I have privateers and I have merchant vessels, and I keep my
storehouses. I have done well up to the present; not so well,
perhaps, now, as I did when I had slave-vessels, which were
most profitable; but my deceased wife persuaded me to give up
that traffic, and I have not resumed it, in honour of her memory.
These foolish women should never interfere in such matters; but
let that pass. What I have to say is, that if you choose after a
year to join me as a partner, I will give you an eighth of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
business, and as we continue I will make over a further share in
proportion to the profits; and I will make such arrangements as
to enable you at my death to take the whole concern upon favourable
terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and, as
he concluded,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as you may imagine, Sir, much gratified
and honoured at your proposal, which I hardly need say that
I willingly accept. I only hope you will make allowance for my
ignorance at first setting off, and not ascribe to any other cause
my imperfections. You may assure yourself that good-will shall
never be wanting on my part, and I shall work day and night, if
required, to prove my gratitude for so kind an offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, it is settled,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion; &ldquo;but what are
we to do with your brother Philip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks for himself, Sir, and does not agree with me on
the question in point. Of course, I have no right to insist that
my scruples should be his; indeed, I fear that I should have
little chance in persuading him, as he is so fond of a life
of adventure. It is natural in one so young. Age will sober
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have no objection to his going on board of a privateer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather that he was in any other service, Sir; but as
I cannot control him, I must submit, if he insist upon following
that profession. He is a gallant, clever boy, and as soon as I
can, I will try to procure him a situation in a king&rsquo;s ship. At
present he must go to sea in some way or the other, and it were,
perhaps, better that he should be in good hands (such as Captain
Levee&rsquo;s for instance) on board of a privateer, than mix up with
those who might demoralize him more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he shall have his choice,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion.
&ldquo;He is a smart lad, and will do you credit wherever he
may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may take the liberty to advise, Sir,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I think
you could not do better than to give the command of the Sparrow-Hawk
to the chief officer, Mr. James; he is a good seaman and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
brave man, and I have no doubt will acquit himself to your satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking the same; and as you recommend him, he
shall take your place. Now, as all this is settled, you may as
well go on board and make known that you have resigned the
command. Tell Mr. James that he is to take your place. Bring
your clothes on shore, and you will find apartments ready for
you on your return, for in future you will of course consider this
house as your residence. I assure you that, now that you do
not leave me, I am almost glad that the affair is arranged as it is.
I wanted assistance, that is the fact, and I hold myself fortunate
that you are the party who has been selected. We shall meet in
the evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion then went away in the direction of his
daughter&rsquo;s room, instead of the counting-house as usual, and I
quitted the house. I did not go immediately down to the wharf
to embark. I wanted to have a short time for reflection, for
I was much overpowered with Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s kindness, and
the happy prospects before me. I walked out in the country for
some distance, deep in my own reflections, and I must say that
Miss Trevannion was too often interfering with my train of
thought.</p>

<p>I had of course no fixed ideas, but I more than once was
weighing in my mind whether I should not make known to them
who I was, and how superior in birth to what they imagined.
After an hour passed in building castles, I retraced my steps,
passed through the town, and going down to the wharf, waved
my handkerchief for a boat, and was soon on board. I then
summoned the officers and men, told them that I had resigned
the command of the vessel, and that in future they were to consider
Mr. James as their captain. I packed up my clothes,
leaving many articles for my successor which were no longer
of any use to me, but which he would have been compelled to replace.</p>

<p>Philip I found was down in the cabin, and with him I had a
long conversation. He stated his wish to remain at sea, saying
that he preferred a privateer to a merchant vessel, and a king&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
ship to a privateer. Not being old enough, or sufficient time at
sea to be eligible for a king&rsquo;s ship, I agreed that he should sail
with Captain Levee, as soon as he came back from his cruise. He
had already sent in a good prize. As soon as my clothes and
other articles were put into the boat, I wished them all farewell,
and was cheered by the men as I pulled on shore.</p>

<p>My effects were taken up to Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s house by the
seamen, to whom I gave a gratuity, and I was met by Mr. Trevannion,
who showed me into a large and well-furnished bed-room,
which he told me was in future to be considered as my own. I
passed away the afternoon in arranging my clothes, and did not
go down to the parlour till supper-time, where I found Miss Trevannion,
who congratulated me upon my having changed my
occupation to one more worthy of me. I made a suitable reply,
and we sat down to supper. Having described this first great
event in my life, I shall for the present conclude.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p>After staying a year with him, Mr. Trevannion proposes to take me into
Partnership, but I decline the offer from conscientious motives&mdash;Miss
Trevannion treats me with unmerited coldness&mdash;This and her
Father&rsquo;s anger make me resolve to quit the House&mdash;What I overhear
and see before my departure&mdash;The Ring.</p></div>


<p>You may now behold me in a very different position, my dear
Madam; instead of the laced hat and hanger at my side, imagine
me in a plain suit of gray with black buttons, and a pen behind
my ear; instead of walking the deck and balancing to the motion
of the vessel, I am now perched immoveably upon a high stool;
instead of sweeping the horizon with my telescope, or watching
the straining and bending of the spars aloft, I am now with my
eyes incessantly fixed upon the ledger or day-book, absorbed in
calculation. You may inquire how I liked the change. At first,
I must confess, not over much, and, notwithstanding my dislike
to the life of a privateer&rsquo;s-man, I often sighed heavily, and wished
that I were an officer in the king&rsquo;s service. The change from a
life of activity to one of sedentary habits was too sudden, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
often found myself, with my eyes still fixed upon the figures before
me, absorbed in a sort of castle-building reverie, in which I
was boarding or chasing the enemy, handling my cutlass, and
sometimes so moved by my imagination as to brandish my arm
over my head, when an exclamation of surprise from one of the
clerks would remind me of my folly, and, angry with myself, I
would once more resume my pen. But after a time I had more
command over myself, and could sit steadily at my work. Mr.
Trevannion had often observed how absent I was, and it was a
source of amusement to him; when we met at dinner, his
daughter would say: &ldquo;So, I hear you had another sea-fight this
morning, Mr. Elrington;&rdquo; and her father would laugh heartily as
he gave a description of my ridiculous conduct.</p>

<p>I very soon, with the kind assistance of Mr. Trevannion, became
master of my work, and gave him satisfaction. My chief
employment consisted in writing the letters to correspondents.
At first I only copied Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s letters in his private letter-book;
but as I became aware of the nature of the correspondence,
and what was necessary to be detailed, I then made a rough copy
of the letters, and submitted them to Mr. Trevannion for his approval.
At first there were a few alterations made, afterwards I
wrote them fairly out, and almost invariably they gave satisfaction,
or if any thing was added, it was in a postscript. Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s
affairs, I found, were much more extensive than I had
imagined. He had the two privateers, two vessels on the coast of
Africa trading for ivory and gold-dust and other articles, two or
three vessels employed in trading to Virginia for tobacco and
other produce, and some smaller vessels engaged in the Newfoundland
fisheries, which, when they had taken in their cargo,
ran to the Mediterranean to dispose of it, and returned with Mediterranean
produce to Liverpool. That he was a very wealthy
man, independent of his large stakes upon the seas, was certain.
He had lent much money to the guild of Liverpool, and had some
tenanted properties in the county; but of them I knew nothing,
except from the payment of the rents. What surprised me much
was, that a man of Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s wealth, having but one child
to provide for, should not retire from business&mdash;and I once made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
the remark to his daughter. Her reply was: &ldquo;I thought as you
do once, but now I think differently. When I have been on a visit
with my father, and he has stayed away for several weeks, you
have no idea how restless and uneasy he has become from want of
occupation. It has become his habit, and habit is second nature.
It is not from a wish to accumulate that he continues at the
counting-house, but because he cannot be happy without employment.
I, therefore, do not any longer persuade him to leave
off, as I am convinced that it would be persuading him to be unhappy.
Until you came, I think the fatigue was too great for him;
but you have, as he apprizes me, relieved him of the heaviest
portion of the labour, and I hardly need say that I am rejoiced
that you have so done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is not that he requires to make money, Miss
Trevannion; and, as he is so liberal in every thing, I must credit
what you assert, that it is the dislike to having no employment
which induces him to continue in business. It has not yet become
such a habit in me,&rdquo; continued I, smiling; &ldquo;I think I could leave
it off with great pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is not that because you have not yet recovered from your
former habits, which were so at variance with a quiet and a sedentary
life?&rdquo; replied she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear it is so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and, I believe, of all habits, those
of a vagrant are the most difficult to overcome. You used to laugh
at me the first few months that I was here. I presume that I am
a little improved, as I have not been attacked lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father says so, and is much pleased with you, Mr. Elrington,
if my telling you so gives you any satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it does, because I wish to please him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And me, too, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, most truly, Miss Trevannion; I only wish I had it in
my power to show how much I study your good opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you risk my father&rsquo;s displeasure for it?&rdquo; replied she,
looking at me fixedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will, provided&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! there is a proviso already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grant that there should not have been any, as I am sure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
that you would not ask me to do any thing which is wrong. And
my proviso was, that I did not undertake what my conscience did
not approve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your proviso was good, Mr. Elrington, for when a woman
would persuade, a man should be particularly guarded that he is
not led into error by a rash promise. I think, however, that we
are both agreed upon the point. I will therefore, come at once
to what I wish you to do. It is the intention of my father, in the
course of a few days, when you shall have accomplished your year
of service, to offer to take you into partnership; and I am certain
it will be on liberal terms. Now I wish you to refuse his offer
unless he gives up privateering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do so at all risks, and I am truly glad that I have your
encouragement for taking such a bold step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you frankly that he will be very indignant. There is
an excitement about the privateering which has become almost
necessary to him, and he cares little about the remainder of his
speculations. He is so blind to the immorality to which it leads,
that he does not think it is an unlawful pursuit; if he did,
I am sure that he would abandon it. All my persuasion has been
useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if a favourite and only daughter cannot prevail, what
chance have I, Miss Trevannion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A better chance, Mr. Elrington; he is partial to me, but I
am a woman, and he looks upon my observations as a woman&rsquo;s
weakness. The objections raised by a man, a young man, and
one who has so long been actively engaged in the service, will,
therefore, carry more weight; besides, he has now become so
accustomed to you, and has had so much trouble taken off his
hands, and, at the same time, has such implicit confidence in
you, that I do not think, if he finds that he has to choose between
your leaving him and his leaving off privateering, he will hesitate
in relinquishing the latter. You have, moreover, great weight
with him, Mr. Elrington; my father is fully aware of the deep
obligation he is under to your courage and self-devotion in the
affair of the Jacobite refugees. You will, therefore, succeed, if
you are firm; and, if you do succeed, you will have my gratitude,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
if that is of any importance to you; my friendship you know you
have already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The entrance of Mr. Trevannion prevented my reply. We had
been waiting for his return from a walk, and dinner had been
ready some time. &ldquo;I have just seen some of the men of the
Arrow,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion, taking off his hat and spencer,
&ldquo;and that detained me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Captain Levee arrived, then, Sir?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but he has sent in a prize&mdash;of no great value&mdash;laden
with light wares. The men in charge tell me he has had a rough
affair with a vessel armed <i>en flute</i>, and that he has lost some men.
Your brother Philip, as usual, is wounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I should here observe, that during the year which had passed
away, the two privateers had been several times in port&mdash;they
had met with moderate success, barely sufficient to pay their
expenses; my brother Philip had always conducted himself
very gallantly, and had been twice wounded in different engagements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I do not think that the loss of a
little blood will do any harm to such a hot-headed youth as Master
Philip; but I hope in a short time to give him an opportunity of
shedding it in the service of the king, instead of in the pursuit of
money. Indeed,&rdquo; continued I, as I sat down to table, &ldquo;the
enemy are now so cautious, or have so few vessels on the high
seas, that I fear your privateering account current will not be very
favourable, when balanced, as it will be in a few days, notwithstanding
this cargo of wares just arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must hope better for next year,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion.
&ldquo;Amy, my dear, have you been out to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir; I was riding for two hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they altered your pillion yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir; it came home last night, and it is now very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I called at Mrs. Carleton&rsquo;s, who is much better. What a
fop that Mr. Carleton is&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what scented powder he
uses, but it perfumed the whole room. Had not Mrs. Carleton
been such an invalid, I should have opened the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
Mr. Trevannion then turned the conversation to some political
intelligence which he had just received, and this engaged
us till the dinner was over, and I returned to the counting-house,
where I found the men who had brought in the prize, and who
gave me a letter from Philip, stating that his wound was of no
consequence.</p>

<p>The communication of Mr. Trevannion took place, as his
daughter had assured me it would, on the anniversary of my entering
into Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s counting-house. After dinner, as
we, as usual, were smoking our pipes, Mr. Trevannion said:
&ldquo;Elrington, you have been with me now one year, and during
that time you have made yourself fully master of your business;
much to my surprise, I acknowledge, but still more to my satisfaction.
That I have every reason to be satisfied with you, you
may imagine, when I tell you that it is now my intention to take
you into partnership, and I trust by my so doing that you will
soon be an independent man. You know the capital in the business
as well as I do. I did say an eighth, but I now propose to
make over to you one-fourth, and to allow your profits of every
year (deducting your necessary expenses) to be invested in the
business, until you have acquired a right to one-half. Of future
arrangements we will speak hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trevannion,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;that I am truly grateful
for such unexpected liberality, I hardly need say, and you have
my best thanks for your noble offer; but I have scruples which,
I must confess, I cannot get over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scruples!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Trevannion, laying down his
pipe on the table. &ldquo;Oh! I see now,&rdquo; continued he after a
pause; &ldquo;you think I am robbing my daughter. No, no, the
labourer is worthy of his hire, and she will have more than sufficient.
You carry your conscientiousness too far, my dear fellow;
I have more than enough for Amy, out of the business
altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware of that, Sir,&rdquo; added I, &ldquo;and I did not, therefore,
refer to your daughter when I said that I had scruples. I must
be candid with you, Sir. How is it that I am now in your
employ?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, because you had a dislike to privateering, and I had
a debt of gratitude to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Sir; but whether you had been pleased to employ
me or not, I had made up my mind, as you well know, from
conscientious motives, not to continue on board of a privateer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I grant that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same motives, Sir, will not allow me to be a sharer in
the profits arising from such sources. I should consider myself
equally wrong if I did so, as if I remained on board. Do not be
angry with me, Sir,&rdquo; continued I; &ldquo;if I, with many thanks,
decline your offer of being your partner; I will faithfully serve
you upon any salary which you may consider I may merit, and
trust to your liberality in every thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion made no reply; he had resumed his pipe,
and continued to smoke it, with his eyes fixed upon the mantelpiece.
As soon as his pipe was out, he rose, put on his hat,
and walked out of the room, without making any further observation.
I waited a few minutes, and then went back to the counting-house.</p>

<p>That Mr. Trevannion was seriously offended, I was convinced;
but I valued the good opinion of his daughter more than I did
that of Mr. Trevannion; indeed, my feelings towards her had,
during the year that I had been in the house, gradually become
of that nature that they threatened much my peace of mind. I
cannot say that I loved her in the usual acceptation of the term,
adoration would better express what I felt. She was so pure,
so perfect, such a model of female perfection, that I looked up
to her with a reverence which almost quelled any feeling of love.
I felt that she was above me, and that, with her wealth, it would
be madness for one in my present position to aspire to her.
Yet with this feeling I would have sacrificed all my hopes and
present advantages to have obtained her approving smile. It is
not, therefore, to be wondered at that I risked Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s
displeasure to gain her approbation; and when I resumed my
seat at my desk, and thought of what had passed, I made up my
mind to be once more an outcast in the world rather than swerve
from the promise which I had made to her. I knew Mr. Trevannion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
to be a very decided man, and hasty when offended. That
he was seriously offended with me there was no doubt. I found
that he had quitted the house immediately after he had left the
room. I had hoped that he had gone to his daughter&rsquo;s apartments,
and that a conversation with her might have produced a
good effect; but such was not the case.</p>

<p>In about half an hour Mr. Trevannion returned, and as he
walked into the back room adjoining the counting-house, he
desired me to follow him; I did so: &ldquo;Mr. Elrington,&rdquo; said he,
sitting down, and leaving me standing at the table, &ldquo;I fear, after
what has passed that we shall not continue on good terms. You
have reproached me, an old man, with carrying on an unlawful
business; in short, in raising your own scruples and
talking of your own conscience, you have implied that I am
acting contrary to what conscience should dictate. In short, you
have told me, by implication, that I am not an honest man.
You have thrown back in my face my liberal offer. My wish to
oblige you has been treated not only with indifference, but I may
add with contumely; and that merely because you have formed
some absurd notions of right and wrong in which you will find no
one to agree with you, except, perhaps, priests and women. I
wish you well, Mr. Elrington, nevertheless. I am truly sorry for
your infatuation, and wished to have served you, but you will not
be assisted by me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Trevannion paused, but I made no reply. After a
time, wiping the perspiration from his forehead with his handkerchief,
for he evidently was in a state of great excitement he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you do not choose to join me from conscientious
scruples, I cannot but imagine that you do not like to serve me
from similar motives, for I see little difference between the two
(and here, Madam, there was some force in his observation, but
it never occurred to me before); at all events, without weighing
your scruples so exactly as to know how far they may or may not
extend, I feel that we are not likely to go on pleasantly together.
I shall always think that I am reproached by you when any thing
is said connected with the privateers&mdash;and you may have twinges
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
of conscience which may be disagreeable to you. Let us, therefore,
part quietly. For your services up to the present, and to
assist you in any other engagements you may enter on, take this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion opened a lower drawer of the table, and put
before me a bag containing, as I afterwards discovered, 250 gold
jacobuses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you well, Mr. Elrington, but I sincerely wish that
we had never met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion then rose abruptly, and, before I could make
any reply, brushed past me, went out at the door, and again
walked away at a rapid pace down the street. I remained where
I stood; my eyes had followed him as he went away. I was completely
surprised. I anticipated much anger, much altercation;
but I never had an idea that he would be so unjust as to throw off
in this way one who for his sake had gone through a heavy trial
and come out with honour. My heart was full of bitterness. I
felt that Mr. Trevannion had treated me with harshness and ingratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;such is the world, and such will ever
be the case with such imperfect beings as we are. How vain to
expect any thing like consistency, much less perfection, in our
erring natures. Hurt but the self-love of a man, wound his
vanity, and all obligations are forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned away from the bag of money, which I was resolved
not to accept, although I had not at the time twenty guineas at my
own disposal. It was now within half an hour of dark; I collected
all my books, put some in the iron safe, others as usual
in my desk, and having arranged every thing as completely as I
could, I locked the safe, and inclosed the keys in a parcel, which
I sealed. Putting Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s name on the outside, I laid
the parcel on the table in the room where we had had our conference,
by the side of the bag of money.</p>

<p>It was now dark, or nearly so, and leaving the confidential
porter, as usual, to shut up the house, I went up to the sitting-room
with the expectation of seeing Miss Trevannion, and bidding
her farewell. I was not disappointed; I found her at her netting,
having just lighted the lamp which hung over the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
&ldquo;Miss Trevannion,&rdquo; said I, advancing respectfully towards
her, &ldquo;I have fulfilled my promise, and I have received my
reward&rdquo;&mdash;she looked up at me&mdash;&ldquo;which is, I am dismissed
from this house and your presence for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; said she, after a pause, &ldquo;that you have not exceeded
my wishes. It appears to me so strange, that I must
think that such is the case. My father never could have dismissed
you in this way for merely expressing an opinion, Mr.
Elrington. You must have gone too far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Trevannion, when you meet your father, you can then
ascertain whether I have been guilty of intemperance or rudeness,
or a proper want of respect in making the communication&mdash;which
I did in exactly the manner you yourself proposed, and my
reward has been such as I state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a better reward, Mr. Elrington, if what you assert
is really correct. You have the reward of having done your duty;
but I cannot imagine that your dismissal has arisen from the mere
expression of an opinion. You&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mr. Elrington,
that as a daughter, I cannot, in justice to a much respected
father, believe that such is the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said in so cold a manner, that I was nettled to the
highest degree. Miss Trevannion had promised me her gratitude,
instead of which I felt that she was doubting my word, and, as it
were, taking the side of her father against me. And this was
the return from her. I could have upbraided her, and told her
what I felt; namely, that she had taken advantage of my feelings
towards her to make me a cat&rsquo;s-paw to obtain her end with her
father; and that now, having failed, I was left to my fate, without
even commiseration; but she looked so calm, so grave, and so
beautiful, that I could not do it. I commanded my wounded
feelings, and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I have the misfortune to meet the displeasure of the
daughter as well as of the father, Miss Trevannion, I have not
another word to say, but farewell, and may you prosper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My voice faltered as I said the last words, and, bowing to her,
I quitted the room. Miss Trevannion did not even say farewell
to me, but I thought that her lips appeared to move, as quitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
the room I took my last look upon her beautiful face. I shut the
door after me, and, overpowered by my feelings, I sank upon
a settee in the ante-room, in a state of giddy stupor. I know not
how long I remained there, for my head turned and my senses
reeled; but I was aroused from it by the heavy tread of Mr. Trevannion,
who came along the corridor without a light, and not
perceiving me, opened the door of the sitting-room where his
daughter still remained. He threw the door too after he had
entered, but it did not quite close, leaving a narrow stream of
light through the ante-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Miss Trevannion in my hearing, &ldquo;you look
warm and excited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reason so to be,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard from Mr. Elrington the cause of it,&rdquo; replied
Miss Trevannion; &ldquo;that is, I have heard his version of it. I am
glad that you have come back, as I am most anxious to hear
yours. What has Mr. Elrington said or done to cause such irritation
and his dismissal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has behaved with insolence and ingratitude,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Trevannion; &ldquo;I offered him partnership, and he refused,
unless I would give up privateering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he stated; but in what manner was he insolent to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insolent!&mdash;told me that he acted from conscientious
motives, which was as much as to say that I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was his language very offensive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not his language&mdash;that was respectful enough; but it
was the very respect which made it insolent. So I told him that
as he could not, from scruples of conscience, join me in privateering,
of course his scruples of conscience could not allow
him to keep the books, and I dismissed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say, my dear father, that he, in a respectful
manner, declined entering into partnership from these
scruples which you mention; that he gave you no other offence
than expressing his opinion, and declining your offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would you have more?&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to know where was the insult, the ingratitude, on
his part which you complain of?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
&ldquo;Simply in refusing the offer. He ought to have felt grateful,
and he was not; and he had no right to give such reasons as he
did; for the reasons were condemning my actions. But you
women cannot understand these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think, my dear father, that we cannot; for I cannot
perceive either the insult or the ingratitude which you complain
of, and such I think will be your own opinion when you have had
time to reflect, and are more cool. Mr. Elrington expressed
nothing more to-day, when he stated his dislike to privateering
from conscientious motives than he did after his return from his
confinement in the Tower, when he gave up the command of the
privateer on those very grounds; and then, when still warm with
gratitude to him for his self-devotion, you did not consider it an
insult, but, on the contrary, took him still nearer to you into
your own house. Why, then, should you consider it an insult
now? Neither can I see any ingratitude. You made him an offer,
the value of which, in a worldly point of view, he could not but
appreciate, and he declined it from conscientious motives;
declined it, as you acknowledge, respectfully; proving that he
was ready to sacrifice his worldly interests to what he considered
his duty as a Christian. When Mr. Elrington told me that you
had dismissed him, I felt so certain that he must have been guilty
of some unpardonable conduct towards you to have induced you
to have resorted to such a step, that I did not credit him when he
asserted the contrary. I could not believe, as a daughter, any
thing so much to the prejudice of my own father, and so much at
variance with his general conduct. I now feel that I have been
most unjust to Mr. Elrington, and conducted myself towards him
in a way which I bitterly regret, and hope by some means to be
able to express my contrition for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amy&mdash;Amy,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion, severely, &ldquo;are you
blinded by regard for this young man, that you side against your
own father? Am I to understand that you have given your
affections without my sanction or approval?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; replied Miss Trevannion; &ldquo;that I do respect and
regard Mr. Elrington is true, and I cannot do otherwise for his
many good qualities and his devotion towards you; but if you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
would ask me if I love him, I reply that such a thought has not
yet entered my head. Without a knowledge of who he is, or his
family, and without your approval, I should never think of
yielding up my affections in so hasty a manner; but I may say
more: these affections have never been solicited by Mr. Elrington.
He has always behaved towards me with that respect,
which, as the daughter of his patron, I have had a right to expect;
but in no instance has he ever signified to me that he had
any preference in my favour. Having assured you of this, my
dear father, I cannot but say that I consider that he has, in this
instance, not only been treated with injustice by you, but also
by me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion. As he said this,
I heard footsteps in the passage, and was about to retreat to my
own room; but as the party came without a light, I remained.
It was the porter, who knocked at the sitting-room door, and
was requested to come in by Mr. Trevannion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Sir, Mr. Elrington is gone out, I believe,
and I found this packet directed to you on the table of the inner
room, and also this bag of money, which I suppose you forgot
to put away before you left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Humphrey, leave them on the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did so, and quitted the room, not perceiving me in
the dark as he passed through the ante-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not taken the money,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trevannion.
&ldquo;He might have done so, as he ought to be paid for his services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume, my dear father, that his feelings were too much
hurt by what passed,&rdquo; said Miss Trevannion. &ldquo;There are
obligations which cannot be repaid with gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These, I perceive, are the keys of the safe; I did not think
that he would have gone away this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I now considered it high time to quit the ante-room, where I
had been irresistibly detained by the conversation which took
place. I hastened to my own chamber, determined that I would
leave the house the next morning before any one was stirring. I
gained it in the dark, but having the means of striking a light, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
did so, and packed up all my clothes ready for my departure. I
had just fastened down my valise, when I perceived a light on the
further end of the long corridor which led to my apartment. Thinking
it might be Mr. Trevannion, and not wishing to see him, I
blew out my own light and retreated to a small dressing-room,
within my chamber, communicating by a glass door. The light
evidently approached, and at last I perceived the party was entering
my room, the door of which was wide open. It was Miss
Trevannion who entered, and turning round with her chamber-light
in her hand, appeared to survey the apartment with a
mournful air. She perceived my valise, and her eyes were fixed
upon it for some time; at last she walked up to the dressing-table,
and, sitting on the stool before it, leant down her head
upon her hands and wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;if those tears were but for me; but it
is not so&mdash;she has been excited, and her tears have come to her
relief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time she raised her head from the table, and said,
&ldquo;How unjust have I been&mdash;and I shall see him no more!&mdash;if I
could but beg his pardon, I should be more happy. Poor fellow!&mdash;what
must he have felt at my harsh bearing. Oh! my father,
I could not have believed it. And what did I say?&mdash;that I had
no feeling for&mdash;well, I thought so at the time, but now&mdash;I am
not quite sure that I was correct, though he&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s better
that he&rsquo;s gone&mdash;but I cannot bear that he should have gone as
he has done. How his opinion of me must have changed! That
is what vexes me&mdash;&rdquo; and again she bent her head down on the
table and wept.</p>

<p>In a moment she again rose, and took her candle in her hand.
Perceiving on the dressing-table a small gold ring which I had
taken off my finger the day before, and had forgotten, she took
it up and examined it. After a little while she laid her light
down on the table, and put the ring upon her finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will keep it till I see him again,&rdquo; murmured she; and
then taking her light, she walked slowly out of the room.</p>

<p>The knowledge I had gained by this unintentional eavesdropping
on my part, was the source of much reflection&mdash;and as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
I lay on the bed without taking off my clothes, it occupied my
thoughts till the day began to break. That I still retained the
good opinion of Miss Trevannion was certain, and the mortification
I had endured at our final interview was now wholly removed.
It was her duty to suppose her parent not in fault till the
contrary was proved. She had known her father for years&mdash;me
she had only known for a short time, and never before had she
known him guilty of injustice. But her expressions and her behaviour
in my room&mdash;was it possible that she was partial to me,
more partial than she had asserted to her father when she was
questioned!&mdash;and her taking away the ring!</p>

<div class="chaphead"><p>A Conspiracy, which ends satisfactorily to all Parties&mdash;Privateering is
abandoned, and Captain Levee and Philip serve the King.</p></div>


<p>The night passed away in attempts at analyzing the real feelings
of Miss Trevannion, and also my own towards her; and
now that I was to be separated from her, I discovered what I
really had not before imagined, that my future happiness was seriously
endangered by my sentiments towards her: in short, dear
Madam, that I was most seriously in love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;of what avail is it to have made this
discovery now, except it were to convince me, as Miss Trevannion
had said, that it were better that I were gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not fail to call to mind her observation about my unknown
parentage and family, and this I reflected upon with
pleasure, as it was the chief objection raised by her, and, at the
same time, one that I could proudly remove, from my birth
being really more distinguished than her own. Should I make
it known? How could I?&mdash;we should, probably, never meet
again. All this, and much more, was canvassed in my mind
during the night, and also another question of more real importance,
which was, what I was to do, and where I was to go? On
this last point I could not make up my mind, but I determined
that I would not leave Liverpool for a day or two, but would take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
up my quarters at my old lodgings, where I had lived with Captain
Levee.</p>

<p>As the day dawned, I rose from the bed, and, taking my
valise on my shoulder, I went softly down-stairs, opened the
street door, and shutting it again carefully, I hastened down the
street as fast as I could. I met nobody; for it was still early,
and arrived at the lodging-house, where I had some trouble to
obtain admittance; the old lady at last opening the door in great
dishabille.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Elrington! is it possible,&rdquo; exclaimed she, &ldquo;why,
what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Madam,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;but that I have come to
take possession of your lodgings for a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And welcome, Sir,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;will you walk up-stairs
while I make myself more fit to be seen. I was in bed and fast
asleep when you knocked; I do believe I was dreaming of my
good friend, Captain Levee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went up-stairs and threw myself on the old settee which was
so familiar to me, and somehow or another, in a few minute&rsquo;s I
was in a sound sleep. How long I might have slept on I cannot
tell, but in less than an hour I was waked up by loud talking and
laughter, and a few seconds afterwards found myself embraced
by my brother Philip and Captain Levee. The Arrow had anchored
at break of day, and they had just come on shore. I was
delighted to see them, as every one is when he meets with friends
when he is in distress. I briefly stated how it was that they found
me there, and when breakfast was on the table, I entered into
full details of what had passed, with the exception of Miss Trevannion
having entered my room&mdash;that I considered too sacred
to repeat to any one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, my dear Elrington,&rdquo; said Captain Levee, &ldquo;that
I have not the scruples which you have relative to privateering,
but still I respect the conscientious scruples of others. There is
no excuse for Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s conduct, and I cannot think but
there is something else at the bottom of all this. You haven&rsquo;t
been making love to his daughter, or, what would amount to
the same thing, she has not been making advances to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have not dared the first, Levee, and you do not know her,
to suppose her capable of the latter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if she had done so, there would have been no harm
done,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;but I will say no more as you look so grave.
Philip and I will now call upon Mr. Trevannion, and while I
engage the old gentleman, Philip shall run alongside of the young
maiden, and between the two we shall get our bearings and
distance, and know how the land lies&mdash;and I will tell you more,
Elrington, although I have no objection to be captain of a privateer,
I certainly consider the command of a king&rsquo;s ship more reputable;
and if I could manage to get the Arrow hired into the
king&rsquo;s service (I still remaining in command of her), I should
prefer it being so. At all events, I&rsquo;ll side with you, and that
will drive the old gentleman on a dead lee-shore. Come along,
Philip&mdash;we shall be with you in two hours, Elrington.&rdquo; With
these words Captain Levee left the room, followed by my
brother.</p>

<p>It was nearly three hours before they returned, and then I
received the following narratives: Captain Levee, as he sat down,
said, &ldquo;Now, Philip, we&rsquo;ll hear your account first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mine is soon told,&rdquo; replied Philip; &ldquo;I had made
up my mind how to act, and did not tell Captain Levee what I
intended to do. When Mr. Trevannion met us in the room behind
the counting-house, he appeared very much flurried: he shook
hands with Captain Levee, and offered me his hand, which I refused,
saying, &lsquo;Mr. Trevannion, I have just seen my brother,
and I hardly need say that nothing will induce me to remain in
your employ. I will, therefore, thank you for my wages at your
convenience.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hey-day, young man,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;you give yourself
strange airs. Well, Sir, you shall have your discharge; I can
do without such snip-jacks as you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Snip-jacks! Mr. Trevannion,&rsquo; replied I; &lsquo;if I must say
it, we are better born and better bred than you or any of your
connections, and you were honoured by our service.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said that, Philip?&mdash;then you were wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
&ldquo;Still, you should not have said it; we took his service, and
therefore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not snip-jacks,&rdquo; interrupted Philip, &ldquo;and his
calling names brought on the reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must admit the provocation, Elrington,&rdquo; said Captain
Levee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go on, Philip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Mr. Trevannion, in a great passion; &lsquo;well,
then, I will soon rid myself of the obligation. Call this afternoon,
Master Philip, and you shall receive your wages. You
may now quit the room.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did so, and put my hat a-cock to annoy him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far his narrative is quite correct,&rdquo; said Captain Levee;&mdash;&ldquo;now
go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;instead of turning out of the house,
I turned into it, and went to the young lady&rsquo;s sitting-room. I
opened the door softly, and found her with her hand up to her
head, looking very sedate and sorrowful. &lsquo;Master Philip,&rsquo; said
she, &lsquo;you startled me; I am glad to see you&mdash;when did you
arrive?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This morning, Miss Trevannion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sit down, and bear me company for a time. Have
you seen your brother?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have, Miss Trevannion,&rsquo; replied I, still remaining on
my feet, &lsquo;and I have just seen your father. I come now to bid
you farewell. I have left the privateer, and shall never join her
again; perhaps I may never see you again either, which, believe
me, I am truly sorry for.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She covered her eyes with her hand, as she leant on the
table, and I saw a tear fall as she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is a sad business altogether, and has distressed me very
much. I hope your brother does not think that I blame him;
tell him that I do not in the least, and that he must forget my
behaviour to him when we parted. I did him injustice, and I
beg his pardon. Tell him so, Philip.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she say those words, Philip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, word for word, and looked like an angel when she said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
so. I replied that I would certainly deliver her message, but
that I must not remain, for fear of Mr. Trevannion finding me
with her, as he ordered me to quit the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;what can be the matter with my poor
father?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Miss Trevannion,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;he was very angry,
and he had reason, for I was very saucy, and that&rsquo;s the
truth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Philip, what did you say to him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I hardly know,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;but I know that I said
more than I ought; for I was very angry at my brother&rsquo;s dismissal.
Good-bye, Miss Trevannion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Trevannion was taking a ring off her finger as I said
good-bye, and I thought she was going to give it me as a keep-sake;
but, after a little hesitation, she put it on again, and then
held out her hand, saying, &lsquo;Good-bye, Master Philip, let us
not part in anger, at all events.&rsquo; I took her hand, bowed, and
turned away to quit the room; when I was at the door I looked
round, and she was sitting with her face in her hands, and I
think she was weeping. I went out into the street, and waited
for Captain Levee, and there&rsquo;s an end of my story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now I&rsquo;ll give you my portion, Elrington:&mdash;As soon
as Philip went out of the room, Mr. Trevannion said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
a most impudent boy, and I am glad that he is gone. You are of
course aware that his brother has left me, and the cause of our
disagreement.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Sir,&rsquo; replied I, drily, &lsquo;I have heard the whole particulars.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you ever hear of such ridiculous scruples?&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Sir, I heard them before, and so did you, when he
gave up the command of the privateer, and I respected them, because
I knew that Mr. Elrington was sincere. Indeed, his observations
on that head are undeniably true, and have had great
weight with me; so much so, that I intend to enter into the king&rsquo;s
service as soon as I possibly can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had seen the look of Mr. Trevannion when I said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
this&mdash;he was stupified. That I, Captain Levee, who had commanded
his vessels so long&mdash;I, the very <i>beau ideal</i> of a privateer&rsquo;s-man,
a reckless, extravagant dare-devil, should also presume
to have scruples, was too much for him. &lsquo;Et tu, Brute,&rsquo;
he might have exclaimed, but he did not; but he stared at me
without speaking for some time; at last he said, &lsquo;Is the golden
age arrived, or is this a conspiracy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neither one nor the other, Sir,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I follow privateering,
because I can do no better; but as soon as I can do
better, I shall leave it off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Mr. Trevannion, &lsquo;you would wish to resign
the command at once. If so, I beg you will not make any ceremony.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have not wished to put you to any inconvenience, Mr.
Trevannion,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;but as you kindly beg me to use no ceremony,
I will take advantage of your offer, and resign the command
of the Arrow this day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, Levee, you have not done so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee, &ldquo;and I have done so,
in the first place, out of friendship to you, and, in the second,
because I wish to be employed in the king&rsquo;s service, and my only
chance of obtaining that wish is doing what I have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will that effect your purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the men have sailed so long with me, that they will
not sail under any other person, if I tell them not. Mr. Trevannion
will find himself in an awkward position, and I think we can
force him to hire his vessel to government, who will gladly accept
such a one as the Arrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I believe, if from her reputation alone,&rdquo; replied I.
&ldquo;Well, Levee, I thank you very much for this proof of sincere
friendship. The plot thickens, and a few days will decide the
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true, and now let me finish my story. &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo;
said Mr. Trevannion, in a very sarcastic tone, &lsquo;that I shall not
be able to find any one to replace you in this moral age, Captain
Levee; but I will try.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I will now answer your sarcasm. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
is some excuse for ignorant seamen before the mast, who enter
on board of privateers: they are indifferent to blood and carnage,
and their feelings are blunted&mdash;there is some excuse even for
decayed gentlemen like me, Mr. Trevannion (for I am a gentleman
born), who, to obtain a maintenance without labour, risk
their lives and shed their blood; but there is no excuse for those
who, having already as much wealth and more than they can require,
still furnish the means and equip vessels of this description
to commit the destruction which they do, for the sake of gain.
There is a sermon, Sir, for you from a captain of a privateer, and
I now wish you good morning.&rsquo; I then got up, and, making a
profound bow, I quitted the room before Mr. Trevannion made
any reply, and here I am. Now all we have to do is to wait
quietly, and see what takes place; but first, I shall go on board
the Arrow, and let them know that I have quarrelled with the
owner. The men are not very well pleased as it is with their want
of success these two last voyages, and it will require but little to
blow up the discontent into a mutiny. Come, Philip, I shall
want you to assist me. We shall be back to dinner, Elrington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I was again alone, I had time to consider what had
passed. What I chiefly dwelt upon was the interview between
Philip and Miss Trevannion&mdash;her message to me&mdash;her hesitation&mdash;and
keeping the ring. I could not help surmising that our
feelings towards each other were reciprocal, and this idea gave
me infinite delight, and repaid me for all that had passed. Then
my brother&rsquo;s hasty declaration to her father, that we were better
born and bred than he was, would certainly be repeated by him
to his daughter, and must make an impression. And what would
Mr. Trevannion do? Would he give way to the unanimous opinion
against him? I feared not, at least without another struggle.
All these questions occupied my thoughts till the return of Captain
Levee and Philip from the privateer. They had well managed
their business. The crew of the Arrow had come to an unanimous
resolution that they would not sail with any other captain
but Captain Levee; and that if he did resign the command of the
vessel, as soon as their wages were paid, and they received their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
share of prize-money, they would leave, and enter into the king&rsquo;s
service.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Trevannion sent for the officer next in
command, to give him the command of the vessel; but as he
went over the side, the men expecting that he was sent for, for
that purpose, told him that they would serve under no one but
Captain Levee, and that he might acquaint the owner with their
determination. This put the finishing blow to Mr. Trevannion.
As soon as this was communicated to him, he was wild with rage
in being thus thwarted in every way. As I afterwards was informed,
he went even to his daughter, acquainted her with all
that had passed, and gave vent to his indignation, accusing her
of being a party in the conspiracy. But this was to be his last effort:
the excitement had been too great, and after dinner he felt
so unwell that he went to bed. The next morning he was in a
raging fever, and at times delirious. The fever was so violent
that the doctors had much to do to reduce it, and for ten days Mr.
Trevannion was in great danger. At last it was got under, leaving
him in a state of great weakness and exhaustion, and his recovery
was any thing but rapid. Humphrey, the porter, had brought us
this intelligence; as now there was no one to transact the business
of the house, and the poor fellow did not know what to do, I
desired him to apply to Miss Trevannion for directions, and told
him that, although I would not enter the house, I would, if she
wished it, see to the more important concerns which could not be
neglected. She was then attending her father, and sent me a
message, requesting, as a favour to her, that I would assist all
I could in the dilemma. I consequently sent for the books, and
gave orders, and made the necessary arrangements as I had done
before I had been dismissed by Mr. Trevannion.</p>

<p>It was nearly five weeks before Mr. Trevannion had sufficiently
recovered to mention any thing about business to him,
and then it was that he learnt from his daughter that I had carried
it on for him during his illness, and that every thing had gone on
as well as if he had acted for himself. Although Miss Trevannion
had not expressed a wish that I should call, she had sent Humphrey
for my brother Philip, to let us know the dangerous state
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
in which her father was, and after that Philip called every day,
and was the bearer of messages to me. As her father recovered,
she told Philip that he had expressed himself very strongly as to
his conduct towards me, and had acknowledged that I was right
in my scruples, and that he was astonished that he had not
viewed privateering in the same light that I did. That he felt very
grateful for my considerate and kind conduct in conducting the
business during his illness, and that as soon as he was well
enough he would call upon me, to beg my pardon for his conduct
towards me. Miss Trevannion also told him that her father had
said that he considered his illness a judgment upon him, and a
warning to open his eyes to his sacrifice of principle to the desire
of gain, and that he received it accordingly with humility and
thankfulness; that it was his intention to offer the privateer vessels
to government, and if they did not hire them, he should
dispose of them in some other way. This was very agreeable intelligence,
and was the source of much conversation between
Captain Levee and me.</p>

<p>About a fortnight afterwards, Mr. Trevannion, who was still
weak, sent me a billet, in which he said that he was afraid that
his anxiety to see me and his being still confined to his room,
rather retarded his recovery, and begged as a favour that I would
accept his acknowledgment in writing, and come to see him.
That I consented to do, and repaired to his house accordingly.
I found him in his room, sitting in his dressing-gown, and he
had evidently suffered much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Elrington,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I trust to your excellent nature
to accept my apologies for the very unjust treatment you have
received at my hands. I am ashamed of myself, and I can say
no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg, Mr. Trevannion, that you will say no more; I accept
the return of your friendship with pleasure,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I am
sorry that you have been so ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;it is good for us to be chastised at
times. My sickness has opened my eyes, and made me, I trust,
a better man. May I ask a favour of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly, Sir,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is that you will execute a commission for me, which is to
go to London on my account, see the government people who
control the naval affairs, and offer the Arrow as a hired vessel.
You know all her qualities so well, and have kept her accounts
so long, that you will be able to furnish them with all necessary
information. I should wish Captain Levee to go with you, and,
if you possibly can, make it a condition that he is taken into the
king&rsquo;s service, and appointed the captain of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do so with pleasure,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more favour I have to beg, Mr. Elrington. When I so
foolishly quarrelled with you, you left a bag of money, to which
you were fully entitled from your good services, upon the table
in the inner room. I trust now that you will not mortify me
by refusing it, or I shall think that you have not really forgiven
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Elrington&mdash;thank you very much. Now
I shall soon get well. To-morrow, perhaps, you will have the
kindness to come and see me again. I feel rather overcome at
present. Remember me kindly to Philip. Good-bye for to-day,&rdquo;
said Mr. Trevannion, holding out his emaciated hand. &ldquo;God
bless you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took his hand and quitted the room, shutting the door softly.
Mr. Trevannion was quite alone when I was with him. Humphrey,
the porter, had shown me up-stairs to the room.</p>

<p>Anxious as I was to see Miss Trevannion, I did not venture
into the sitting-room, but passed the door and went down-stairs;
when I was going out of the street door, Humphrey followed
me, and said Miss Trevannion wished to see me. I went back
again with a beating heart, a sensation I had not felt before,
when about to go into her presence. She was standing by the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Elrington,&rdquo; said she, as I bowed upon entering, &ldquo;I
did not think that you could carry your resentment against me so
far as to leave the house without asking to see me; but if you do
not wish to see me, &rsquo;tis a duty I owe to myself to wish to see you,
if only for a moment, that I may beg your pardon for my conduct
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
towards you when we last parted. I have suffered much since
that, Mr. Elrington; do not make me suffer more by continuing
your resentment. Recollect I am but a weak woman, and must
not be judged so severely as one of your own sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to pardon that I am aware of, Miss Trevannion,&rdquo;
replied I; &ldquo;I did not intrude upon you just now, because
being no longer an inmate of the house, and not having parted
with you in complete amity, I thought it would be presumptuous
in me so to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very generous, Mr. Elrington,&rdquo; replied she;
&ldquo;now take my hand, and I promise never to be so hasty
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took the proffered hand, and raised it respectfully to my
lips. I had never done so before; but Miss Trevannion showed
no signs of displeasure, or attempt to withdraw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think my father looks very ill, Mr. Elrington?&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From his appearance, I think that he must have suffered
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am most thankful that you have come to see him, Mr. Elrington.
You have no idea how his mind was troubled, and how
he longed to be reconciled to you. I trust he has made his
peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always had too much respect for your father, and
gratitude for his kindness to me, to have made that a work of
difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rejoice me much&mdash;make me very happy, Mr. Elrington,&rdquo;
replied Miss Trevannion, as the tears dropped fast from her
eyes. &ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have become very
weak and nervous during my father&rsquo;s illness&mdash;and sitting up with
him so much,&mdash;but it is over now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had much anxiety, I see, Miss Trevannion; you
are pale and thin to what you were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did my father&mdash;? but I have no right to ask such
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would inquire, Miss Trevannion, whether any thing
was said as to future arrangements?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
Miss Trevannion made a sign of assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have promised to execute a commission for him, and am
going to London, accompanied by Captain Levee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get rid of those wretched privateers, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, and I am to come to-morrow to arrange further;
but I think you want to return to your father&rsquo;s room, so I will now
take my leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are considerate, Mr. Elrington; I did want to go up-stairs;
but before I go I have some property of yours to place in
your hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed, thinking that she referred to the ring, which I perceived
on her finger, and was annoyed that she was in such haste
to return it. But, on the contrary, she went to the buffet and
brought out the bag of gold jacobuses, which she laid on the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very proud, Mr. Elrington, not to take what was
fairly your due,&rdquo; said Miss Trevannion, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is much more than I have ever earned,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but
your father made me promise not to refuse it a second time, and
of course I shall now take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart was much lightened when I found that it was the
gold, and not the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then good-bye, Mr. Elrington; to-morrow I shall see you,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Trevannion then left the room and hastened up-stairs to
her father, and I went home to my lodgings. I narrated the substance
of what had passed between Mr. Trevannion and me to
Captain Levee and Philip, and also that I had been kindly received
by Miss Trevannion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like the reconciliation and arrangement very much,&rdquo;
said Captain Levee; &ldquo;and as you have such a bag of gold, and I
have not fifty guineas in the world, you shall stand treat in London,
Elrington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will, with pleasure; it will only be discharging an old
debt, Levee. Philip shall go with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Captain Levee, &ldquo;do you not think they will
recognize their state prisoner, and be cautious of a Jacobite?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
&ldquo;They may remember the name,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but my person
was seen but by few. I do, however, think it would be advisable,
as I shall have to sign papers, to take another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; replied Captain Levee; &ldquo;what shall we
call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see; I&rsquo;ll have a good name. I had a relative of the
name of Musgrave; I think I will borrow his name. What say
you, Philip. Will you be for the future Philip Musgrave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, with all my heart. The name appears to fit me
better than that of Elrington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, Madam, did I resume my real name without any suspicion
on the part of Captain Levee; but I could not well sign
government papers with an assumed one.</p>

<p>On the following day I called upon Mr. Trevannion, who
received me with great affection, and it was arranged that I should
set off in three days, which time would be required for preparation,
and to make the necessary purchases. To supply funds
for the journey, Mr. Trevannion gave me another bag of jacobuses,
of the same amount as the former, saying that he wished
us to appear bravely when we arrived in London, and that he
should require no account of the expenditure, only that if the
contents of the bag were not sufficient, he would supply more.
This was nothing more but an excuse on his part to be generous;
for one quarter of the money would have been sufficient for all
needful expenses. I told him that I had taken the name of Musgrave,
as that of Elrington might be remembered to the injury of
the proposal, and he said that it was well thought of by me. Miss
Trevannion had entered the room when I mentioned that to her
father, and afterwards had quitted it. After I had taken leave of
Mr. Trevannion, I went down to the sitting-room, where I found
his daughter waiting for me. We had much friendly discourse,
and at one time she said, &ldquo;I heard you say that you had taken the
name of Musgrave for your intended journey. Do you intend to
retain that name when you return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;perhaps it is your real name. Excuse
a lady&rsquo;s curiosity, but is not that the fact?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
&ldquo;Miss Trevannion,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;my real name must at present
remain a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to say, it will no longer be a secret if intrusted to
me? I thank you, Sir, for the compliment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not intend to imply that, Miss Trevannion; I fully
believe that you can keep a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you fully believe so, you might, then, reply to my
question; the more so, as I now pledge myself to keep your
secret most faithfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Miss Trevannion, my real name is Musgrave,&rdquo; replied
I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your confidence, Mr. Musgrave, which shall
not be misplaced. I might now follow up my inquiries as to why
you changed your name, with many other queries; but I am too
discreet for that&mdash;the time may come when I shall know all; but
I am content with your proof of confidence, and thank you for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Trevannion never was so lively and communicative with
me before, as she was this morning; there was a friendliness
without any of her usual reserve, and I left her more full of admiration
and devotion than ever.</p>

<p>In three days more our preparations were made, and taking
leave of Miss Trevannion and her father, who was recovering,
and had admitted company to his room, we set off on horseback,
as we had done before, and attended by the same two men of
Captain Levee&rsquo;s who had served us on a former journey to London.
We had no adventure whatever on this journey which could
be worth narrating, and I shall therefore say that we arrived in
good health and spirits, and took up our abode at once at our
former lodging-house, instead of going to the inn. We were
welcomed by the hostess, who had her house almost empty. The
following day I made inquiries, and, in consequence, went to
the Navy Office, and requesting to see one of the head clerks,
informed him of the occasion of my coming up to London. He
was very civil, and replied that the government were in want of
vessels, and he had no doubt but they would have the Arrow, as
she was well known as a strong privateer. I then inquired whether
they thought it likely that Captain Levee might be taken into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
the service, stating what an excellent crew the Arrow had, and
that they would not remain in her, unless they were commanded,
by him, in whom they had great confidence.</p>

<p>The clerk replied that it might be done certainly,&mdash;&ldquo;but,&rdquo;
added he&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, you cannot expect people to do such kind
offices without they are rewarded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I perfectly understood him, and replied, that, of course, I
did not expect it; but I was so ignorant as to what ought to be
done, that I begged that he would give me his advice, for which
I should be most grateful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you understand me, Mr. Musgrave, and that
is sufficient. I will be plain with you. It will cost 100 guineas
to obtain what you want for Captain Levee, and of that money I
shall not receive a doit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be most happy to give that sum and half as much
more, to obtain my wish, Sir, and shall feel much obliged to
you in the bargain; and while I am negotiating, I may as well
state that I have a brother who sails with Captain Levee, who is
most anxious to be with him, and sail as his lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will cost another fifty guineas, Mr. Musgrave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am most willing,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we must first get the vessel hired into the service.
You have your tonnage and equipment all on paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every thing that is requisite; and, moreover, every cruise
she has made, the actions she has fought, and the prizes she has
taken under the command of Captain Levee, and with the crew
now on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Furnish all these documents, Mr. Musgrave, and leave it
to me. I am to understand that you perfectly agree to the terms
I have proposed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, Sir; and, if you please, I will sign a memorandum
to that effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;we never put such things down on
paper. It is an affair of honour and good faith. You say your
money is all ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a minute&rsquo;s warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
&ldquo;That is sufficient, Mr. Musgrave. I will now wish you good
morning. Send me the documents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have them in my pocket, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better still; then the affair may be arranged this afternoon,
and you may call to-morrow at about two in the afternoon; and
you may as well bring the money with you, as you can but take it
away again if every thing is not to your satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I returned to the lodgings quite delighted with the prospect of
such a fortunate issue to my mission, and was in good time for
dinner. I did not tell Captain Levee or Philip of what had passed,
but merely that I considered that there was a good chance of success,
and that I was to call on the following day. That night we
went to the theatre, and saw a play performed written by Shakspeare,
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and called the &ldquo;Merry
Wives of Windsor.&rdquo; We were much pleased with the character
<i>Falstaff</i>, a fat knight, full of humour. The next day, at the
time appointed, I called upon the head clerk, who told me that
every thing was arranged according to my wishes; that the hiring
of the vessel was according to her tonnage; and he considered
that the price offered by the government was fair and liberal; so
did I, and immediately accepted it. He then drew from his desk
the articles of agreement between the government and the owner
of the vessel, and at the same time, the warrants for Captain
Levee and Philip, to act as commander and lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Musgrave, all you have to do is to sign the first
paper, and fulfil the other portion of our agreement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I immediately pulled out the bag of money which I had brought
with me, and after counting it over, the clerk gave me his pen
to sign the document, and handed to me the warrants for Philip
and Captain Levee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have behaved liberally in this affair, Mr. Musgrave,&rdquo;
said the gentleman, as he locked up the bag of money in his desk;
&ldquo;if at any time I can be of use to you, you may command me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Sir,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I may by-and-by have to ask
you to exert your influence in behalf of my brother, that he may
obtain the command of one of the king&rsquo;s ships, and if you can
help me, I shall be most grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
&ldquo;Depend upon it I will,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;and I beg you will
use no ceremony on making the application.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then shook hands with me, and I went home. Dinner was
over when I came back, but the hostess had put away some victuals
for me, and while I was eating them, I gave them an account
of my success, handing their warrants to Captain Levee
and Philip. They could hardly credit me, even when the documents
were in their hands, but pledging them to secrecy, I told
them by what means I had been so successful. Whereupon they
thanked me, and we then went out to procure the uniforms suitable
to their respective ranks, and this occupied us till the
evening, when we agreed to go to the cockpit and see the fights
between the various animals, with which Philip particularly was
much delighted. As we had nothing to detain us in London, and
it was necessary that the Arrow should immediately run round to
the Nore, we determined, as the uniforms were to be ready on
the following day, that the day after that we would return to
Liverpool.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p>We return to Liverpool&mdash;I have an interview with Miss Trevannion&mdash;Plutus
interferes with Cupid, and I sail again for the coast of Africa.</p></div>


<p>We set off and arrived at Liverpool, without accident, late
on the sixth night, when we repaired to our usual lodgings. The
next day I called to tell Mr. Trevannion that I had returned, and
was informed by Humphrey that he was quite strong again, and
very anxious to see me, although he had no idea that I should return
so soon. Humphrey went up to announce my arrival, and
Mr. Trevannion admitted me immediately, although he was not
yet out of bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear that you have not been successful,&rdquo; said he, as he
took my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Sir, I have succeeded in every thing,&rdquo;
and I then gave him an account of what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I am very glad of it, and recollect I
must be at the expense, as, without you had incurred it, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
schooner would not, in all probability, have been hired. And
now I want to consult with you about something else. Here is a
letter from Captain Irving, of the Amy, brought home by the
Chester Lass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were two vessels employed on the Gold Coast, which
belonged to Mr. Trevannion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion, &ldquo;and give me your
opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did so: Captain Irving stated that he had pushed the two
vessels up a small river on the coast, which he had not known of
before, and had fallen in with a black ruler, who had never yet
treated with the English; but only with the Spaniards, for slaves.
That his English commodities were quite new to the natives, and
that, in consequence, he had made a most fortunate traffic with
them, and had loaded a vessel with ivory, wax, and gold-dust to
the amount of 1,000 pounds, and that he had sent the Chester
Lass, remaining himself, to continue the barter before it was
known to the other ships on the coast, which it would soon be.
He continued, that he had not sufficient of the articles which
were most valued by the natives, and requested that Mr. Trevannion
would immediately despatch another vessel with various
goods enumerated, and that then he should be able to fill his
own vessel as well as the one that he had despatched home; that
the river was in such a latitude, and the mouth difficult to discover;
that he sent a little sketch of the coast, which would facilitate
the discovery&mdash;but that no time was to be lost, as the
sickly season was coming on, and it was very unhealthy at
that time.</p>

<p>As I folded up the letter, Mr. Trevannion said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, here is an invoice of the whole cargo sent home by
the Chester Lass. I reckon it worth about 7,000<i>l.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked over the invoice, and agreed with Mr. Trevannion,
that it was well worth that, if not more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is most important, you will acknowledge, Musgrave,&rdquo;
said Mr. Trevannion; &ldquo;but before I go any further, I trust that,
now the only difficulty is got over, you will not refuse to be my
partner; the only difference I intend to make is, that I now offer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
you one-fourth instead of one-eighth. Silence gives consent,&rdquo;
continued Mr. Trevannion, as I did not immediately reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so astonished at your munificent offer, Sir, that I
could not well speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s agreed; so say no more about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion,
taking me by the hand, and pressing it warmly&mdash;&ldquo;and
now to business. My idea is, to sent out the Sparrow-Hawk,
being so fast a sailer. Of course, as a privateer, she has done
her work; and as the government wish the complement of the
Arrow to be increased, I think we cannot do better than to fill her
up with some of the Sparrow-Hawk&rsquo;s men, leaving about twenty-five
on board of her, and sending her out as soon as possible to
the coast, with the articles which Captain Irving requests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Sir, that it will be the best plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But whom to send is the difficulty,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion.
&ldquo;Captain Paul, of the Chester Lass, is very ill, and not likely
to be out of bed for some time; and even if he were well, I have
no opinion of him in an affair of this moment. If, as Captain
Irving says, he can fill the Amy, her cargo will be worth three
times that of the Chester Lass; but, of course, the destination
of the Sparrow-Hawk must be a secret, and I do not know whom
to intrust her to. We require some one in whom we can put confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Sir,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;and, if you have no
objection, I think that the best plan will be for me to go myself;
I shall be back again in ten weeks at the furthest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as you will now have a strong interest in it, I really
think so too. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know whom else we can trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Sir, and I will go myself, and I think
the sooner the better; but I do not know whether we can obtain
all the goods requisite immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can have them in five or six days,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion;
&ldquo;I sent Humphrey out to make inquiry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events, I must look to them myself; and there are
many other things to manage, so I had better wish you a good
morning now, Mr. Trevannion, and in the evening I will call
again, and let you know what I have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said he, and I then took my leave.</p>

<p>I certainly was very much astonished as well as much pleased
at Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s liberality relative to the partnership, and I
could now look forward to competency in a few years at the
furthest. Certainly, if Mr. Trevannion had been hasty in his
conduct towards me, he had made most noble reparation. I first
returned to the lodgings and told Captain Levee and Philip what
had passed; they immediately proposed that we should all go
together on board the Sparrow-Hawk, that I might make my arrangements,
and that they might persuade some of the men to
join the Arrow. I first picked out the men I wished to sail with
me; and then they talked over the rest, who that evening went on
shore for their wages, and the next morning joined the Arrow, as
Captain Levee was anxious to get round to the Nore. The day
after the men joined, the Arrow sailed, which I was not sorry for,
as it left me more at leisure to expedite my own affairs. Philip
promised to be my correspondent, and I bade them both farewell
with regret. I called in the evening, as I had promised, upon
Mr. Trevannion, and he then gave me the deed of partnership,
signed and dated the day when he first made the offer, and we
had quarrelled; but I did not see Miss Trevannion; much to my
regret, her father said that she was ailing. The business I had
to transact, and fitting out the Sparrow-Hawk, so completely
occupied me, that it was now three days that I had been at Liverpool
without having seen her, and I was much annoyed at it, as I
had called every day. My feelings towards her were now stronger
than before. She was never out of my thoughts, and I hardly
know how it was that I transacted business as I did. This
evening I was determined, if possible, that I would see her, and
find out why she avoided me, as it appeared to me that she did.
When I called, therefore, I did not ask to see her father, but told
Humphrey to find out where Miss Trevannion was, and say that
I requested to speak with her. Humphrey returned, and said
that she was in the sitting-room, to which I instantly repaired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fearful, that I have given you some unintentional cause
of displeasure, Miss Trevannion,&rdquo; said I, as I entered, &ldquo;for you
have appeared to avoid me since my return.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
&ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Musgrave, I have not,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;I was
most anxious to see you, and have thought it very unpolite, I may
add, unkind, on your part not to have come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been in the house every day, and sometimes twice a-day,
with your father, Miss Trevannion, and have never met you.
Once I inquired for you, and your father told me you were unwell,
whereas Humphrey had but five minutes before told me
that you were well and in good spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humphrey told the truth, and so did my father. I was in
good health and spirits, and in five minutes afterwards I was ill
and unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust I was no party to it, Miss Trevannion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were a party to it, but not the great offender, who was
my father. He had told me that upon your return he had installed
you as his partner, and had done you the justice you had
deserved; and then he told me that you were going out to the
coast of Africa in the Sparrow-Hawk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very true, Miss Trevannion; but where is the offence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The offence is this: my father no sooner does you justice
than he wants more ivory and gold-dust, having more than
enough already; but I told him it was as bad as privateering, for
in either case he sends people out to sacrifice their lives, that he
may gain more money. I have no patience with this foolish
pursuit of wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all your father&rsquo;s kindness to me, Miss Trevannion, I
could do no less than accept the offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have been more wise and more just to yourself
to have refused it, Mr. Musgrave. I read the letters to my father
when they arrived, and you know what Captain Irving says about
the unhealthiness of the climate. You have been my father&rsquo;s
best friend, and he should not have treated you thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did value life, Miss Trevannion; but really the kind
interest you have expressed on this occasion makes me feel as if
my poor life was of some value. To one who has been such a
football of fortune as I have been, and who has hardly, known a
kind feeling towards him ever expressed, it is a gratification that
I really appreciate, and coming from one whom I respect and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
esteem more than any other person in the world, it quite overpowers
me. Indeed, Miss Trevannion, I am truly grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was correct when I said that it overpowered me, for it did
completely, and I was so oppressed by my feelings, that I reeled
to a chair, and covered up my face with my hands. What would
I have given to have dared to state what I felt!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are ill, Mr. Musgrave,&rdquo; said Miss Trevannion, coming
to me. &ldquo;Can I offer you any thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no reply; I could not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Musgrave,&rdquo; said Miss Trevannion, taking my hand,
&ldquo;you frighten me. What is the matter? Shall I call Humphrey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt her hand tremble in mine, and, uncertain what to think,
I came to the resolution to make the avowal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Trevannion,&rdquo; said I, after a pause, and rising from
my chair, &ldquo;I feel that this internal conflict is too great for me,
and if it lasts it must kill me. I give you my honour that I have
for months tried every thing in my power to curb my desires and
to persuade myself of my folly and rash ambition, but I cannot
do so any longer. It were better that I knew my fate at once, even
if my sentence should be my death. You will ridicule my folly,
be surprised at my presumption, and, in all probability, spurn
me for the avowal, but make it I must. Miss Trevannion, I have
dared&mdash;to love you; I have but one excuse to offer, which is,
that I have been more than a year in your company, and it is impossible
for any one not to love one so pure, so beautiful, and
so good. I would have postponed this avowal till I was able to
resume my position in society, by the means which industry
might have afforded me; but my departure upon this business,
and the kind of presentiment which I have, that I may not see you
again, has forced it from me. In a few days I leave you&mdash;be
gentle with me for my involuntary offence&mdash;pity me while you
condemn, and I will return no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Trevannion did not reply; she breathed quick, and
stood motionless. I gathered courage; I looked in her face, there
was no displeasure&mdash;I approached her, she was half-fainting,
and put her hand upon my shoulder to steady herself. I put my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
arm round her waist; and led her to the sofa, and knelt at her
feet, watching every change in her beautiful countenance. I took
her hand and pressed it to my lips; by degrees I became more
bold, and got by her side, and pressed her to my heart. She
burst into tears, and wept with her head on my bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be angry with me,&rdquo; said I, after a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I appear as if I was angry with you?&rdquo; replied she, raising
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; but I cannot believe my happiness to be real. It
must be a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is life but a dream?&rdquo; replied she mournfully. &ldquo;Oh,
the coast of Africa! How I dread it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so I confess did I from that moment; I had a presentiment,
as I had told her, that something would go wrong, and I
could not get over the feeling.</p>

<p>I shall no longer dwell upon what took place on that delightful
evening, Madam; suffice to say, that Miss Trevannion and I
were mutually pledged, and, after an exchange of thought and
feeling, we parted, and when we did part I pressed those dear
lips to mine. I went home reeling with excitement, and hastened
to bed, that I might have unrestrained freedom of thought. I
enacted the scene of the evening over and over again; recalled
each motion, each look, every word which had passed, and,
defying fever and presentiment of evil, imagined also our happy
meeting to part no more. It was long before I could compose
myself to sleep, and when I did, I need not say who it was who
occupied my dreams. I called as soon as I could venture so to
do on the following day, and had a long interview with my dear
Amy. Before I went up to her father, I tried to soothe her anxiety
upon my approaching voyage, and to persuade her that there was
little or no danger to be apprehended in so short a stay. Willingly
would I have given it up, but Mr. Trevannion had so set his
mind upon it, and I had, by my consent, rendered it so impossible
for him to find a substitute in time, that I could not do
so, and I persuaded Miss Trevannion that I was right in acting to
my promise. One question that came forward was, whether we
should make known our engagement to her father at once, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
this was decided in the negative. Much as he liked me, he was
not yet prepared to receive me so suddenly as a son-in-law, and
Amy was of opinion that the communication had better be postponed.
To this, of course, I gave a willing assent. I was
satisfied with the knowledge of her affection, which I felt would
never change. As I was talking with her father, after my interview
with Amy, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Elrington, or Musgrave, I hardly know which to
call you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Musgrave is my real name, Sir,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Musgrave&mdash;Musgrave&mdash;where did I know a Musgrave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are from the north,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was going to say, that I really wish I
could find some one else to take your place in this voyage, for I
do not much like your going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, my dear father,&rdquo; said Miss Trevannion, who was
standing by him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! Miss Amy, what have you to do with it, I should like
to know, and how can it concern you whether Mr. Musgrave goes
or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said so, Sir, because I know how you will feel his loss
for so long a period. You know how you did feel his loss before,
and I do not wish to see you working so hard, as you will have to
do it without his assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s kindly thought, Amy, at all events; but still
I fear that Mr. Musgrave must go, and I must work by myself till
he comes back; so it&rsquo;s no use saying any more about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amy sighed and made no reply. On the third day after this
interview, every thing was ready, and on the following morning
I was to sail. Mr. Trevannion had so many directions to give,
and kept me so wholly with him, that I could hardly find time to
speak to his daughter. However, it was agreed that as I was to
sail at daylight, that she would see me after her father had gone
to bed. Our meeting took place&mdash;need I say that it was a tender
one. We renewed our vows over and over again, and it was not
till past midnight that I tore myself away. Old Humphrey looked
very knowingly at me when he let me out of the street-door. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
slipped a guinea in his hand and wished him good-bye. I hastened
on board of the Sparrow-Hawk, and desiring to be called
before daylight, went down into the cabin. There I remained
sitting at the table, and thinking of Amy so long, that when the
mate came down to wake me, he found that I was still sitting
there, having never been to bed during the whole of the night.</p>

<p>I started from my reverie and hastened on deck to get the
schooner under weigh. It was soon done, although we were,
comparatively speaking, short-handed. There was a fine breeze,
and lightened as she now was, the little vessel flew through the
water. Liverpool was soon out of sight, and we were dashing
down the Irish Channel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sails well, now,&rdquo; said I to the second mate, a very
clever man, and much better educated than most seamen, for he
could navigate, as well as being a first-rate seaman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; replied Olivarez, &ldquo;she walks fast. She is not
too deep now,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;what a slaver she would make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man was not an Englishman, but a Brazilian Portuguese
by birth, although he had long been out of his country. Having
set her course, I went down below, that I might indulge in my
castle-building more at my ease. The wind increased to a gale,
but as it was from the northward, and bore us to our destination,
it was welcomed. We soon crossed the Bay of Biscay, and were
in more genial latitudes; and, after a rapid run of about four
weeks, I found myself nearly in the latitude given to us of the
river where the Amy was at anchor. I then hauled in for the
shore, which was very low, and required being approached with
caution. We saw some towering palmtrees at sunset, and then
we hove to; the next day we again stood in, and having ascertained
our exact latitude at noon, we found ourselves about four
miles to the northward of the river&rsquo;s mouth. We shaped a course,
and in two hours I made out the marks given for our guidance in
the rough sketch of Captain Irving, and thus satisfied that I was
right, ran directly for the mouth of the river. Captain Irving was
correct in saying it was difficult, for it was not until we were
within a mile that we could find any opening; but at last we did,
and at the same time perceived the mast of two vessels at some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
distance up the river. We stood in, and found that there was no
bar at the river mouth, which was a very unusual circumstance
on this coast. The soundings were gradual, and in an hour
afterwards we anchored between the Amy and a fine schooner
under British colours. Captain Irving recognized the Sparrow-Hawk,
and immediately came on board. After the usual salutations,
he told me that his vessel was half-laden, but that he
waited for the articles he had sent for to enable him to complete
his cargo. I told him that I had them on board, and he should
have them as soon as he sent his boats. He stated that no vessels,
except those engaged in the slave-trade, had ever come into this
river, and that they only brought the cloth and other articles usual
in the trade; but that his assorted cargo had astonished the
people, and they were wild to possess things which they had never
before seen. They had offered slaves in quantities, but finding
that he would not take them in exchange, they had now brought
down ivory and gold-dust. He told me how glad he was that I
had come, as the river was very sickly, and was becoming more
and more so every day; that out of twelve men he had already
four down with fever.</p>

<p>I inquired of him what that vessel was on the other side of us.
He replied it was a Liverpool slave-trader, and that the captain
appeared to be a very good sort of man; that he never indulged in
liquor, nor was given to profane language.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards the captain of the slaver came on
board to pay his respects, and I asked him down in the cabin,
and gave him beer and cheese, the two greatest luxuries in those
climes. He appeared, as Captain Irving stated, a very quiet,
well-behaved, serious person, which I was rather surprised at.
When we repaired on deck, I observed, as the vessel was close
to us, that there were two very large dogs on board, who, at the
sight of the captain, bayed furiously. He told me that they were
Cuba bloodhounds, and that he never went on shore without
them, as they were the most faithful and courageous animals,
and he considered that he was safer with them than with half a
dozen armed men. Shortly afterwards Captain Irving and he
both took leave. As there were still some hours of daylight,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
Captain Irving sent his boats for the goods, and after that, as
the evening fell, I went down below, as Captain Irving requested
I would do, and by no means remain on deck after sun-down,
as it was extremely unhealthy.</p>

<p>On the following day Captain Irving went on shore with his
goods and trafficked most favourably. Indeed, as we afterwards
found out, he had procured in exchange more ivory than his vessel
would hold, besides much gold-dust. The day after I went
on shore with Captain Irving to call upon the king, as he called
himself. He was seated in front of a hut made of palmetto
leaves, with a lace coat on, but no other garment whatever, so
that he made a curious appearance. After a little conversation,
I went away, and hearing that the slaver was taking her cargo
on board, about a hundred yards further up, I walked in that
direction. The slaves were brought down in about twenty at a
time, all of them fastened by the neck to a long bamboo pole,
which confined them all together. One string of them had been
sent down and put in the boat, and another was standing ready
for embarkation; when as I cast my eyes over them and commiserated
their misery, I observed a female whom I thought I had
seen before. I looked again, and behold! is was Whyna, the
princess who had been so kind to me in my captivity. I went up to
her and touched her on the shoulder. She turned round, as well
as the lashing to the pole would permit her, and on seeing me gave
a faint scream. Without ceremony I took out my knife and released
her, and led her away. She fell down at my feet and
kissed them. The black man who had charge of the delivery of
the slaves was very angry, and ran up to me, brandishing his
long stick; but the captain of the schooner, who was on shore,
and who had witnessed what I had done, saluted him with a kick
in the stomach, which made him quiet enough. In few words I
told the captain of the slaver that I was once in captivity, and this
woman had befriended me, requesting him to name his price and
I would willingly pay it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth mentioning, Sir,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;women are
as cheap as dirt; take her and welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I must pay her ransom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well then, Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am in great want of a telescope;
you have one on board, will you let me have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and many thanks into the
bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lifted up the poor creature, who was sadly emaciated and
weak, and led her to the boat of the Amy and put her in. Captain
Irving came down, and we returned on board. It was with
great difficulty that, after I had given the poor creature some refreshment,
which she was really in need of, I could recollect
sufficient of her language to make myself understood by her; but
by degrees words came to my memory, and as she spoke I recovered
more. As well as I could make her out, the warriors
had risen against the king on account of his barbarity, and had
cut him to pieces; and that all his wives and servants had been
sold as slaves. I promised her that she should not be a slave,
but should come to my country and be taken care of.</p>

<p>She kissed my hands, and as she smiled her thanks, she reminded
me of the Whyna of former times. I did not, however,
think it advisable that she should come on board of the schooner,
and I requested Captain Irving to take charge of her, and let her
want for nothing, telling him that I intended that she should go
home in his vessel. He willingly consented, and I hailed the
schooner for a boat and went on deck. Whyna followed, but I
told her I was obliged to go on board of the schooner, and that
she had better go and lie down. As she probably thought that
the Amy was my vessel, and that I was going away on a visit, she
complied with my request, and went down with Captain Irving,
who led her into a state-room which was not occupied.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived on board the schooner, I sent the telescope
which the captain of the slaver had begged for. Whyna had
said to me, &ldquo;I shall be your slave now,&rdquo; evidently expecting that
she was to remain with me, but that I could not consent to. Miss
Trevannion had heard from me my adventures when in captivity,
and I would not on that account allow Whyna to be in the same
vessel with me. The next day Captain Irving came on board to
tell me that he had two more men down with the fever, and that
he wished I could give them some assistance in getting his cargo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
on board, which I did, and before night the Amy was loaded up
to the hatchways, and there still remained a considerate number
of elephants&rsquo; teeth on shore in the hut where he received them. I
therefore determined, as his crew were evidently sickening fast,
that he should sail immediately, and that I would take the
remainder of the ivory on board of the schooner and follow him,
giving him a rendezvous to wait at until I joined him, that
we might proceed home in company. That night three of my men
were ill.</p>

<p>I was on board of the Amy, and had been talking with
Whyna, who wanted to know why I did not sleep on board of the
vessel. I told her that I could not, but that we were to go
to England directly, and that I was living on board of the
schooner. Captain Irving weighed at daybreak, and in an hour
was out of the river, and as I was as anxious to be clear of such
an unhealthy spot, I manned my boats and went on shore for the
ivory that was left. I found that it would take the whole of the
day to embark it, as we had to go two miles further up the river
than the depth of water would permit the vessel to do; for the
ivory was in a hut close to the king&rsquo;s house. I had sent off four
boat-loads, and it being then noon, I went off with the fifth myself,
that I might get my dinner, leaving the second mate to
attend on shore, and taking with me the first mate who messed in
the cabin. As we were in the middle of the stream, the boat
struck against a stump of a tree, as we supposed, and knocked
so large a hole in the bow that she began to fill. I immediately
ordered the men to pull for the nearest point, which was on the
opposite side of the river, that we might ground the boat to prevent
her sinking.</p>

<p>The first mate, who was a very active man, finding that the
elephants&rsquo; teeth prevented his reaching the bow of the boat, and
stuffing into it some oakum which he had found in the stern
sheets, sounded with the boat-hook, and finding that there was
not more than three feet of water where we were pulling, jumped
over the bows to push the oakum into the hole; but the poor fellow
had not been a few seconds in the water, when he gave a shriek,
and we perceived that a large shark had snapped him in two.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
This was a sad mishap, and the men, terrified, pulled as hard
as they could, while two of them baled out the boat, to gain the
shore, for we knew what fate awaited us if we sunk in the river.
With great exertion we succeeded, running her up among the
canes, with grew on that side of the river so thick that it was difficult
to force your way through them.</p>

<p>We landed up to our knees in mud, and, throwing out the
ivory, we found that a whole plank was rent out, and that it was
impossible to repair our boat; and we were hidden by the canes
from those who could have assisted us, had they known that we
required their assistance, and we had no possible means of communication.
At last I thought that if I could force my way through
the canes to the point down the river, I could hail and make
signals for assistance; and, desiring the men to remain by the
boat, I set off upon my expedition. At first I got on pretty well,
as there were little paths through the canes, made, as I imagined,
by the natives; and, although I was often up to my knees in thick
black mud, I continued to get on pretty fast; but at last the canes
grew so thick that I could hardly force my way through them, and
it was a work of excessive labour. Still I persevered, expecting
each second that I should arrive at the banks of the river, and be
rewarded for my fatigue; but the more I laboured the worse it
appeared to be, and at last I became worn out with fatigue, and
quite bewildered. I then tried to find my way back, and was
equally unsuccessful, and I sat down with any thing but pleasant
thoughts in my mind. I calculated that I had been two hours
in making this attempt, and was now quite puzzled how to
proceed. I bitterly lamented my rashness, now that it was
too late.</p>

<p>Having reposed a little, I resumed my toil, and was again,
after an hour&rsquo;s exertion, compelled, from fatigue, to sit down in
the deep black mud. Another respite from toil, and another hour
or more of exertion, and I gave myself up for lost. The day was
evidently fast closing in&mdash;the light overhead was not near so
bright as it had been; and I knew that a night passed in the
miasma of the cane was death. At last it became darker and
darker. There could not be an hour of daylight remaining. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
determined upon one more struggle, and, reeking as I was with
perspiration and faint with fatigue, I rose again, and was forcing
my way through the thickest of the canes, when I heard a deep
growl, and perceived a large panther not twenty yards from me.
It was on the move as well as I was, attempting to force his way
through the canes, so as to come to me. I retreated from him
as fast as I could, but he gained slowly on me, and my strength
was fast exhausting. I thought I heard sounds at a distance, and
they became more and more distinct, but what they were, my
fear and my struggles probably prevented me from making out.
My eyes were fixed upon the fierce animal which was in pursuit of
me, and I now thanked God that the canes were so thick and impassable;
still the animal evidently gained ground&mdash;until it was
not more than five yards from me, dashing and springing at the
canes, and tearing them aside with his teeth.</p>

<p>The sounds were now nearer, and I made them out to be the
howling of other animals. A moment&rsquo;s pause, and I thought it
was the baying of dogs; and I then thought that I must have arrived
close to where the schooner was, and that I heard the
baying of the bloodhounds. At last I could do no more, and I
dropped, exhausted and almost senseless, in the mud. I recollect
hearing the crashing of the canes, and then a savage roar, and
then yells, and growls, and struggles, and fierce contention&mdash;but
I had fainted.</p>

<p>I must now inform the reader that about an hour after I had
left the boat the captain of the slaver was pulling up the river, and
was hailed by our men in our long-boat. Perceiving them on
shore on that side of the river, and that they were in distress, he
pulled towards them, and they told him what had happened,
and that an hour previous I had left the boat to force my
way through the cane-brakes, and they had heard nothing of me
since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madness!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;He is a lost man. Stay till I come
back from the schooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back to the schooner, and taking two of his crew,
who were negroes, and his two bloodhounds, into the boat, he
returned immediately, and as soon as he landed he put the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
bloodhounds on my track, and sent the negroes on with them. They
had followed me in all my windings, for it appeared that I had
travelled in every direction, and had come up with me just as I
had sunk with exhaustion, and the panther was so close upon me.
The bloodhounds had attacked the panther, and this was the
noise which sounded in my ears, as I lay stupified and at the
mercy of the wild beast. The panther was not easily, although
eventually, overcome, and the black men coming up, had found
me and borne me in a state of insensibility on board of the
Sparrow-Hawk. The fever had come on me, and it was not till
three weeks afterwards that I recovered my senses, when I learnt
what I have now told the reader, and much more, with which I
am about to make him acquainted.</p>

<p>When I recovered my senses, I found myself in the cabin of
the Sparrow-Hawk. For some hours I was confused and wandering,
but I rallied from time to time, till I could at last
recognize the beams and carlines over my head. I was too weak
to move, and I continued to lie on my back till I again fell asleep;
how long I do not know, but it must have been for many hours,
and then when I awoke I found myself much stronger.</p>

<p>I could now turn on my bed, and doing so I perceived a young
man of the name of Ingram by my side in a doze, with his eyes
shut. I called him in a faint voice, and he started up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been very ill,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have I not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, indeed you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been trying to recollect all about it, but I cannot
as yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth remembering, Sir,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Do you
wish any thing to drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had better go to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot do that. I feel as if I should like to get up. Where
is Mr. Thompson? I must see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thompson, Sir,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you recollect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Sir, he was bitten in two by a shark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shark!&rdquo; this was the key-note required, and my memory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
returned. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I recollect now all, all. I recollect the
panther and the cane-brakes. How was I preserved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bloodhounds killed the panther, and you were brought
on board insensible, and have been in a raging fever ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be so,&rdquo; replied I, collecting my senses after a few
moments of thought. &ldquo;It must be so. How long have I been
ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the twenty-first day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The twenty-first day!&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;Is it possible? Are none
of the men ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir, they are all well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hear the water against the bends. Are we not still at
anchor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir, the second mate got the schooner under weigh as
he found you were so ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have been ill twenty-one days. Why we must be near
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We expect to make the land in a few days, Sir,&rdquo; replied
Ingram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven for all its mercies,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I never expected
to see old England again. But what a bad smell there is.
What can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is the bilge-water, Sir,&rdquo; replied Ingram.
&ldquo;People who are ill and weak always are annoyed by it; but I
think, Sir, if you would take a little gruel, and then go to sleep
again, it would be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I fear I am not very strong, and talking so much has
done me no good. I think I could take a little gruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Sir, I&rsquo;ll go and get some made, and be back very
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, Ingram, and tell Mr. Olivarez, the second mate, that
I would speak to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; replied the man, and he left the state-room.</p>

<p>I waited some time listening for the arrival of the second mate,
and then I thought that I heard odd noises in the hold before the
bulk-head of the state-room in which I was lying, but I was still
very weak, and my head swam. After a time Ingram came down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
with the gruel, into which he put some sugar and a spoonful of
rum, to flavour it, as he said. He offered it to me, and I drank
it all, for I had an appetite; but whether it was that I was very
weak, or the rum he put in was more than he said, it is certain
that I had hardly given him back the basin than I felt so drowsy
that I turned away from him, and was soon again in forgetfulness.</p>

<p>This Ingram was a young man who had been apprenticed to an
apothecary, and had taken to the sea. He was well educated,
and a very merry fellow, and I had chosen him as one who could
attend upon me in the cabin, and at the same time be otherwise
useful if required, as he was a very good seaman, and very active.
When I awoke again I felt convinced that I must have slept
through the night, as it was broad daylight, as before, but Ingram
was not by my bed-side. There was no bell in the state-room,
and I was obliged to await his coming. I felt much stronger
than the day before, and now proposed getting out of bed as
soon as Ingram should come down into the cabin. I now remembered
that the second mate had not come down to me, and
heard noises and murmurings in the hold as I had the day
previous, which surprised me, and I became more anxious for
the return of Ingram. At last he came, and I told him that I had
been awake more than an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel yourself, Sir?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite strong. I should like to get up and dress. Perhaps
I may be able to get on deck for a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that you had better wait, and hear
what I have to tell you, Sir. I would not tell you yesterday,
because I thought it would be too much for you; but as I see you
are really better to-day, I must say that I have strange things to
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried I, with surprise. &ldquo;Strange things. By
the bye, why did not Olivarez come to me yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will explain all to you, Sir, if you will lie down and listen
to what I have to say, and take the news quietly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Ingram, I will do so. Now pray go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were brought on board in a state of fever and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
insensibility by the captain of the slaver. He said, as he lifted you
over the side, that you were a dead man. We all thought the
same, and you were taken down into the cabin with that persuasion
on the part of the whole crew. Your delirium and fever
increased, and every hour it was expected that you would give up
the ghost. Now, Sir, two days afterwards the slaver sailed with
his cargo, and we were left alone in the river. Olivarez, who of
course commanded, talked to the men. He said that you were
as good as dead already, and that he thought that this was a fair
opportunity for their making money. He proposed that the ivory
still on shore should be changed for slaves, which he said the
negroes would gladly do, and that we should run with our cargo
to the Brazils. He said that it was useless our remaining in the
river, as we should all lose our lives in the same way that you
had done, and that he thought, as commanding the schooner,
he knew what would best please the owner, who had long
employed vessels in the slave-trade, and would not be sorry to
find that we had run a cargo, and would reward them all liberally.
That this would be an excuse to leave the river immediately,
whereas otherwise they would have to wait till you recovered or
died, and by that time they might half of them be dead themselves.
Do you understand me, Sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, perfectly. Go on, Ingram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir, the men did not perceive what he was about,
and replied that so long as they left the river they did not care
how soon, and that it was better that we should take a cargo of
slaves at all events, for Olivarez was in command now, and they
should do as he ordered them. I made no reply, indeed Olivarez
never put the question to me. Well, Sir, the ivory was soon
exchanged for slaves, who are now on board, and it is the slaves
whom you have smelt and complained of. We received on board
140, and provisions sufficient with what we had, and having
taken in all the water we could below and on deck, we made sail
out of the river, and have since steered for the Brazils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Olivarez has taken a most unwarrantable responsibility,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;and one that he shall answer for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, Sir,&rdquo; replied Ingram, &ldquo;you have only heard the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
first part of the story. When we had been three days at sea, Olivarez,
who had been talking to the men, one by one and apart,
called them together, and said, it was an opportunity not to be
lost, that they had possession of the vessel, and the owner would
never have a clue to where she had gone, and that now was the
time to take possession of her for themselves, and employ her in
the slave-trade on their own account. That, sailing so fast,
nothing could overhaul her or board her, and, therefore, they
were free from danger. He then proposed that he should command
and navigate, and receive one-half of the profits, and that
the other half should be divided among the crew&mdash;the expense of
the provisions, &amp;c. being paid out of it previous to their sharing
and making a calculation, he showed them that every voyage
would be worth about 100<i>l.</i> a-man after all expenses were paid.
The crew consented at once to the terms&mdash;all but me; and when
he asked me, my answer was, that I would consent to nothing
while you were yet alive. I said that, because I was afraid that
they would murder me, or throw me overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, Ingram; go on, and let me hear it all at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then you will soon be freed from your difficulty,&rsquo; said
Olivarez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not know that, Sir,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;for I think Mr.
Musgrave may get over it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;well, then, so much the worse
for him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As he, Olivarez, said this, the whole of the crew, to do
them justice, cried out, that there should be no murder, for if
there was, they not only would have nothing to do with the affair,
but would make it known at the first port to which they came.
That you had always been a kind, good officer, and were too
brave a man to die in that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, my men,&rsquo; said Olivarez, &lsquo;I never had an idea of
the kind, and I promise you, if he lives through it, there shall
be no murder; I will put him on shore at the first port we arrive
at, but in such a way as to secure our safety&mdash;that we must
look to.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
&ldquo;The men said, that that was all right, and then they all
agreed to join him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you, Ingram,&rsquo; said Olivarez, &lsquo;what do you say?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What I said before,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;that as long as Mr. Musgrave
lives I will come to no agreement whatever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Olivarez, &lsquo;it is but postponing your decision;
I know that you will join us. So now, my lads, as we&rsquo;re
all agreed, we may as well go to dinner.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel shall pay for this,&rdquo; cried I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Sir, hush, I pray; say nothing, but wait patiently
and see what turns up. We are not yet at Rio, and when we are,
we may be able to do something, but every thing depends upon
keeping quiet, for if the men become alarmed, they may be persuaded
to kill you to save themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very true, Ingram,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;Leave me now for
half an hour, I wish to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may imagine, my dear Madam, my agitation at hearing
this intelligence. I who had thought that I was within a few days&rsquo;
sail of Liverpool, to be there received by my cherished Amy, to
find myself in the hands of pirates, and close to the Brazils with
a cargo of slaves; which they, or rather Olivarez, had taken in
the vessel to Rio that he might not be discovered, for he might
have found a better mart for his live cargo. And then what would
be the anxiety of Amy and her father when I was not heard of? It
would be supposed that the schooner was upset in a squall, and
all hands had perished. Excited and angry as I was, I felt the
truth of what Ingram said, and that it was necessary to be
quiet. Perhaps I might by that means not only preserve my life,
but again find myself in my own country. When Ingram returned,
I asked him if Olivarez knew that I was better, and had recovered
my reason. He replied that he did, but that he had told
him I was so weak that I could hardly recover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;keep him in that belief as long as
you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He now offered me more gruel, which I took, and I believe
that he put an opiate in it, for shortly after I had taken it, I again
felt drowsy, and was soon fast asleep. I awoke sooner than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
before, for it was night, and I heard the voice of Olivarez on deck;
from what I gathered, land was in sight, and I heard him order
the schooner to be hove to. In the morning Ingram came down
in the cabin, bringing me some breakfast, which I ate heartily,
for I was recovering fast, and had become quite ravenous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land is in sight,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, it is; but we are many miles to the northward of
Rio, I understand, for Olivarez knows the coast well. We shall
not be in to-day, if we are to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel quite strong now,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and I want to
get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do so, Sir,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but if you hear any one coming
down the ladder, get into bed again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Ingram&rsquo;s assistance I dressed myself, and went into
the cabin. I reeled as I walked, but as soon as I felt the cool
breeze from the stern-ports, I was revived, and in an hour I
could walk quite strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard any more?&rdquo; inquired I of Ingram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olivarez asked me this morning how you were. I replied that
you were recovering fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you will share his fate, whatever it
may be, since you have been so careful of him, and have put us
in such a dilemma; but I&rsquo;ll contrive to dispose of you both.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made no reply, Sir, as I knew that would only irritate
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did right, Ingram; a few days will decide our fate.
I do not think that he dares to murder us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I think he wishes it, if he can be clear of us with
safety to himself,&rdquo; replied Ingram.</p>

<p>Two days more passed away, and then Ingram told me that
we were a few miles from the town, and should soon be at
anchor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go softly,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and tell me what is going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went up the ladder, but soon came down again, saying,
&ldquo;We are locked in, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was very much annoyed at this, but it could not be helped&mdash;our
only remedy was patience; but I must confess that I was in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
a state of great anxiety. We heard the anchor let go, and boats
came on board, after which all was silent for the night. The
next morning we heard them open the hatches, and the slaves
were ordered upon deck. The day was passed in landing them.
I was ravenously hungry, and asked Ingram whether they intended
to starve us. He went up the ladder to call for victuals,
when he found on the upper step of the ladder a large vessel full
of water and some cooked provisions, which had probably been
put there during the night. There was enough to last two or three
days. The next day passed and no one came near us, and I had
some thoughts of dropping out of the stern-ports and attempting
to swim on shore; but Ingram, who had put his head out of them
as far as he could, told me that we must be at some distance
from the shore, and there were several sharks playing round the
stern, as is always the case with vessels laden with slaves.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, put an end to our suspense,
for the companion was unlocked, and Olivarez, accompanied by
four Portuguese, came down into the cabin. He spoke to them
in Portuguese, and they advanced, and seizing Ingram and me
by the collar, led us up the ladder. I would have expostulated,
but of course could not make myself understood. Olivarez, however,
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resistance is useless, Mr. Musgrave; all you have to do
is to go quietly with these men. As soon as the schooner has
sailed, you will be released.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;it maybe so, Olivarez; but mark my
words, you will repent this, and I shall see you on a gibbet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust the wood is not yet out of the ground,&rdquo; replied he;
&ldquo;but I cannot waste any more words with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then spoke to the Portuguese, who appeared to be government
officers of some kind, and they led us to the gangway; we
went into the boat, and they pulled us to the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can they be taking us, Ingram?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows, Sir, but we shall find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I attempted to speak to the officers, but they cried &ldquo;<i>Silentio</i>,&rdquo;
which word I fully understood to mean &ldquo;silence,&rdquo; and finding
that I could not induce them to hear me, I said no more. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
landed at a jetty, and were then led through the streets to a large
square. On one side of it was a heavy building, to which they
directed their steps. The door was opened for us, and we were
led in. A paper was produced by our conductors, and was
apparently copied into a book, after which they went away,
leaving us with the people who had received us, and who, by their
appearance, I knew to be gaolers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what crime am I accused?&rdquo; inquired I.</p>

<p>No reply was given, but two of the subordinates took us away,
unlocked a massive door, and thrust us into a large court-yard,
full of men of every colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, as the door closed upon us, &ldquo;we are in
gaol at all events; but the question now is, shall we be released
as Olivarez had stated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard to say,&rdquo; replied Ingram. &ldquo;The question is,
what gaol is this? Could we find any one who could speak English,
we might discover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several of those around us had come towards us to examine
us, and then left us, when, as we were conversing, a negro
came up, and hearing what we said, addressed us in English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Massa want one to speak English&mdash;I speak English&mdash;some
long while on board English vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my good fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;can you tell us
what this gaol is, and what prisoners are confined here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa, every body know that, suppose he live at
Rio. This gaol for people that go dig diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean! massa&mdash;people sent here to work in diamond-mines
all life long till they die. Keep &rsquo;em here till hab plenty to
send up all at one time. Then guard take them up the country,
and they go dig and wash for diamond. Suppose you find
very big diamond, you go free. Suppose not, den you die
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heavens!&rdquo; cried I to Ingram, &ldquo;then we are condemned
as slaves to the mines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ingram with a sigh. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s better than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
working in the quicksilver-mines. At all events, we shall have
fresh air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fresh air without liberty,&rdquo; cried I, clasping my hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Sir, courage, we do not yet know our fate. Perhaps
we may, as Olivarez said, be allowed to go free after the
schooner sails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head, for I was convinced otherwise.</p>

<p>After remaining in the court about two hours, it being then
near to nightfall, the gaolers came out into the yard, and we
were all driven into a large apartment, the walls of which were of
such solid materials, and the floor of large flag-stones, as to
prevent any possibility of escape. I was never in such a scene of
filth and wretchedness. There was not a spot where one could
be driven without being defiled in some way or another; and so
many human beings&mdash;one half of whom were negroes&mdash;being
crowded into so small a space, with only one barred window, so
high up as only to serve as a ventilator, created an atmosphere
worse than any slave-vessel&rsquo;s hold. I leaned with my back
against the wall, and, I must say, never was so miserable in my
life. I thought of Amy, and my sanguine hopes and anticipations
of happiness, now all wrecked. I thought of Captain Levee and
my brother Philip careering over the seas, free as the wind. I
thought of poor Whyna, and the distress she must feel at finding
I did not rejoin her. I planned a hundred schemes to make known
my situation, but every scheme, as soon as I weighed it, I found
was hopeless. Still weak from previous disease, I felt as if I should
be suffocated if I remained long in this pestiferous abode, and I
wept like a child. Daylight came at last, and soon afterwards the
door was opened; we were admitted into the yard, and all hastened
to the large tub of water, which was soon emptied. The fighting
and scrambling to obtain first possession was really revolting. An
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
hour afterwards some coarse provisions were served out, and then
we learnt, to our great delight, that we were immediately to set out
for the mines. It would be thought that this could be no great
cause for exaltation; we were about to go to pass the rest of our
lives in bondage; but all misery is comparative, and sooner than
have remained another night in that dreadful hole, I would have
welcomed any change. About an hour afterwards a guard of
dirty-looking soldiers came in; we were all handcuffed to a long
chain, at about two feet apart, one on each side, so that we
walked in pairs, and as soon as the first chain was full&mdash;and I
was handcuffed to it&mdash;we were ordered out into the square to
wait for the others. My superior dress and appearance as an
Englishman excited much curiosity; people pointed to me and
made remarks, but I had no opportunity of communicating with
any of the authorities, nor would it have been of any use if I had
had. We remained there more than an hour, as the other chains
of prisoners came out one by one; we were five chains in all,
about forty on a chain. We were then ordered to move on, walking
between a guard of about twenty or thirty soldiers, who
marched, on each side of us, with their muskets and bayonets
fixed, about three yards from each other. In another hour we
were clear of the town, and threading our way through a lane
bounded on each side by prickly pears and other shrubs. There
was no want of merriment among the party; they talked and
laughed with one another, and the soldiers who guarded them,
and appeared to care little for their fate. As for me, I was
broken-hearted with the disgrace and the villainous manner in
which I had been thus sacrificed. My heart was full of bitterness,
and I could gladly have lain down and died, had I not been still
buoyed up with some faint hope that I should have an opportunity
of making my position known, and obtain my release. I will pass
over the journey, as one day was but the forerunner of the other.
We halted at noon, and were supplied with fruit and maize, but
we were never unchained, day or night. In a short time I was like
all the rest&mdash;covered with vermin, and disgusting to myself. It
was, I think, between four and five weeks before we arrived at our
destination, which was in the district of Tejuco, and the locality
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
of the diamond-mines was called the Sierra de Espinha&ccedil;o. This
sierra, or mountain, was a ridge of inaccessible precipices on each
side of a narrow valley, traversed by a small river called the Tequetinhonha,
and in this valley, and in the bed of the river, were
the diamonds found, for which we were condemned to toil for the
remainder of our days. As we entered the ravine, I perceived
how impossible it would be to escape; even if a person could find
his way back, after having succeeded in his escape. For many
miles the road was a narrow path cut on the side of the mountain,
yawning precipice below and inaccessible rocks above, and this
narrow way was at every two miles blocked up by a guard-house
built upon it, and through the portcullis of which it would be necessary
to force a way. And here we were, thousands of miles
away from civilized life, in the heart of a country uninhabited except
by occasional bands of Indians. At last we filed through the
last of the guard-houses, and found ourselves in a wider part of
the ravine, which was crowded with buildings of various descriptions.
We were led up to the director&rsquo;s house, and our names,
persons, and descriptions were taken down by a clerk. When
my turn came, and I was asked in Portuguese who I was, I shook
my head, and replied &ldquo;Ingles.&rdquo; An interpreter was called, and
I then stated my name, and begged the director would hear what
I had to say. He shook his head, and, after they had taken my
description, desired me to go away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not explain for me?&rdquo; said I to the interpreter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he won&rsquo;t hear what you have to say; if he would,
every man on the chain would attempt to prove that he was sent
here by mistake. You may, by-and-by, find an opportunity to
speak to him, that is, after you have learnt Portuguese, and have
been here a year or two; but it will do no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the whole of the journey, I had been separated from
Ingram, and now, for the first time since we left prison, I had
an opportunity of shaking him by the hand. I need not say how
glad I was to meet again my companion in misfortune, and our
only fear was now, that we should be again separated; but such
was not the case. There were regular lodgings or barracks for
the slaves, which were certainly not bad; but as all escape was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
considered impossible, any one who chose to raise a little hut for
himself out of the bushes which grew on the rocks was permitted
so to do. The hours of work were regular; we were allotted out
in gangs, which took up a certain square of the river, or river&rsquo;s
side; we worked from daylight till near dusk, with only an hour
allowed for repose in the heat of the day. There was a superintendent
over each gang of twenty, who watched them and made
them work. These superintendents were controlled by inspectors,
who had the charge of four or five gangs, and who brought
unto the director the produce of the day&rsquo;s toil. The work was
simple. The sand and alluvial soil were thrown into troughs with
small sieve bottoms, out of which escaped all the smaller matter,
when it was washed with the water from the river. The stones
and larger particles were then carefully examined, and any diamonds
found were taken out and delivered to the superintendents,
who then made them over to the inspectors, when they
came round. The inspectors carried them to their houses (for
they had houses from government), and in the evening delivered
every diamond found to the director. After a short time, I found
that the office of superintendent, and also of inspector, was open
to any of the slaves who conducted themselves well; and that the
whole of those now employed in the offices were slaves for life,
as well as ourselves. What puzzled me was, how so many people,
for in all we amounted to seven hundred or more, were to be
found in food; but I afterwards discovered that the government
had farms and herds of cattle at a few miles&rsquo; distance, cultivated
by slaves and Indians expressly for the purpose. Our rations
were scanty, but we were permitted to cultivate as well as we
could any spot we could find on the arid side of the mountain as a
garden; and some of them, who had been there for many years,
had, in course of time, produced a good soil, and reared plenty
of vegetables. To my surprise, I found at least twenty Englishmen
among the whole mass of slaves; and one or two of them
were inspectors, and several of them superintendents&mdash;saying
much in favour of my countrymen. Their conversation and their
advice tended much to soothe the hardships of my captivity, but
I found from them that any hopes of ever leaving the mines were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
useless, and that our bones must all be laid by the side of the
mountain. Of course, Ingram and I were inseparable; we worked
in the same gang, and we very soon built a hut for ourselves;
and Ingram, who was a light-hearted young man, set to work to
make a garden. He moved heavy stones on the sides of the mountain,
and scraped up all the mould he could find; sometimes he
would get his handkerchief full, but not often, but, as he said,
every little helped. He killed lizards for manure, and with them
and leaves he made a little dung-heap, which he watered, to assist
putrefaction. Every thing that would assist, he carefully
collected; and by degrees he had sufficient for a patch of four or
five yards square. This he planted; and with the refuse made
more manure; and in the course of a few months, by incessant
activity and assisted by me, he had a very tolerable patch of
ground covered with this manure and the alluvial soil washed out
by the diamond-seeking, mixed up together. We then obtained
seeds, and grew vegetables like the rest, and this proved a great
increase to our comforts&mdash;that is our bodily wants; but my mind
was far away. Amy Trevannion was never out of my thoughts,
and I fell into a deep melancholy. I worked hard at my vocation,
and was fortunate enough to find some good diamonds, long before
I had been a year at the mines. Having acquired the Portuguese
language, I was soon after raised to the office of superintendent.
I now no longer worked, but overlooked others, with
a cane in my hand to administer punishment to those who neglected
their business. I cannot say that I liked the change, I
was not so miserable when I was employed, but I did my duty
with diligence. Ingram was in my gang, and another Englishman,
an old man,&mdash;I should think not less than seventy years
old. He told me that he belonged to a merchant vessel, and in a
drunken brawl a Portuguese had been killed; he and two others
had been condemned to the mines, but the others were dead long
ago. About a month after my elevation, this old man, who was
very feeble, and whom I treated with great kindness on account
of his age&mdash;exacting no more than I thought he could well perform&mdash;fell
sick. I reported him as being really ill, and Ingram,
who was by no means a bad doctor, told me that he would die.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
A few hours before his death he sent for me to his hut, and after
thanking me for my kindness to him, he said that he knew he was
dying, and that he wished to leave me all his property (which the
slaves are permitted to do), that is, he left me his garden, which
was the best on the Sierra, his hut, which also was a very good
one, and then putting his hand under the leaves which formed his
bed, he pulled out a tattered, thumbed book, which he told me
was a Bible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first I read,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to pass away time, in this melancholy
place, but of late I have read it I hope to a better purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked the poor man for his present, and wished him good-bye.
A few hours afterwards he was dead, and Ingram and I
buried him by the side of the mountain. Shortly afterwards our
inspector died, and, to my astonishment, I was put into his
place. I could not imagine why I was thus so fortunate in being
promoted, but I afterwards found out that, although I had never
but casually seen her, I was indebted for my good fortune to a
fancy which the director&rsquo;s eldest daughter (for he had his family
with him) had taken for me.</p>

<p>This was singular, for I had never spoken to her, and what
is more strange, I never did speak to her, nor did she ever attempt
to speak to me, so that it was wholly disinterested on her part. I
had now still less to do, and was in constant communication with
the director, and one day stated to him how it was that I had been
brought there. He told me that he believed me, but could not
help me, and after that, the subject was never again mentioned
between us. Having little to do, I now took up the Bible given
me by the old Englishman, as I had time to read it, which I had
not before, when I was employed the whole day; but now I had
a convenient cottage, as I may call it, of my own, and plenty of
leisure and retirement.</p>

<p>I studied the Bible carefully, and found much comfort in it.
Not that I was content with my lot&mdash;that I never could be while
I was separated from Amy&mdash;but still I found much consolation,
and I became, to a certain degree, resigned. I thought of my
former life with disgust, and this second reading of the Bible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
for the reader may recollect that the first took place when I was
first confined in the Tower, was certainly of great advantage to
me. I had more time to dwell upon it&mdash;more time for reflection
and self-examination&mdash;and every day I reaped more advantage
and became more worthy of the name of Christian. I now prayed
fervently, and I think my prayers were heard, as you, my dear
Madam, will also think as I continue my narrative. About three
months after I had been appointed an inspector, Ingram was
taken ill. At first he complained of disordered bowels, but in a
few days inflammation came on, which ended in mortification.
He was in great agony until the mortification took place, when he
obtained comparative relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Musgrave,&rdquo; he said, as I was at his bed-side,
&ldquo;in a few hours I shall have escaped from the mines, and be no
more in bondage. I shall follow the poor old Englishman, who
left you his executor. I am about to do the same. I shall now
make my will verbally, as we have no writing-materials here, and
leave you all I possess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you not more serious, Ingram,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;at such
a moment as this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am most serious,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I know that in a few
hours I shall be no more, and I trust in the mercy of Him who
died for kings and for slaves; but, Musgrave, I have a secret to
tell you. Do you recollect the story in the fairy tales of the little
white cat whose head was obliged to be cut off, and who then
turned into the most beautiful princess in the world? Well, my
secret is something like hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought, by his continuing in this strain, that his head was
wandering. I was about to speak to him, when he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what has occasioned my death? I will tell you
the secret. I was washing for diamonds, when I found one of a
size which astonished me. I knew it was of great value, and I
did not choose that the King of Portugal should receive such a
benefit from my hands. I put it into my mouth to secrete it,
hardly knowing what I should do afterwards, but I was thinking
how I should act, when one of the superintendents passing (that
crabbed old Portuguese belonging to the next gang), and seeing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
me idle and in deep thought, he struck me with his cane such a
smart rap on the shoulders, that he not only made me jump out
of my reverie, but the diamond went down my throat. I&rsquo;m sure
if I had tried to swallow it I could not have done so, but the shock
forced it down. Well, this has occasioned my death, for it has
remained in my stomach and occasioned the stoppage, which has
ended in inflammation and mortification. I feel it here even now;
give me your finger, don&rsquo;t you feel it? Well, now you understand
why I talked of the little white cat. Don&rsquo;t cut off my head, but
when I am dead, just put your knife down there and take out the
diamond and bury it, for I tell you&mdash;and they say dying men see
clearer than others&mdash;but that I am certain you will be released
from these mines, and then the diamond will be a fortune to you,
and you will find that being my executor was of some value to
you. Now, pray&mdash;no scruple&mdash;I entreat it as a last favour,
promise me that you will do as I wish&mdash;pray promise me, or I
shall die unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not help promising him to execute his wishes, he appeared
so earnest and asked it as a last favour, but I felt very
repugnant at the idea. In another hour poor Ingram breathed
his last, and I was most melancholy at the loss of so worthy a
friend, who had by serving me been subjected to the same slavery
as myself. I left the hut and went to my own house, thinking
over the strange communication that had been made to me. And
why, thought I, should I obtain this diamond? I have no chance
of leaving this; yet, who knows, Ingram prophesied in his dying
moments that I should&mdash;well, at all events, I will keep my promise
to the poor fellow. I reported his death to the director, and,
about an hour afterwards, went to the hut where he lay. His
countenance was placid, and I looked at him for a long while,
and queried whether he was not happier than I was or ever could
be. But, to comply with his request&mdash;I could not bear the idea.
I did not want the diamond, and I, who in my early career had
thought nothing of cutting and maiming the living man, now
shuddered at the idea of making an incision in a dead body. But
there was no time to be lost, the burials always took place at
sunset, and it was near the hour. I bent a piece of bamboo cane
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
double, like a pair of sugar-tongs, and then putting my finger to
the part of his stomach which he had pointed out, I felt that there
was a hard substance, and I made an incision with my knife&mdash;probing
with the blade. I touched the diamond, and then using
the piece of cane as a pair of pincers, I contrived, after one or
two attempts, to extract it. I threw the diamond without examination
into a pan of water which stood by the bed, and covering up
the body, I made a hole in the floor of the hut and buried the
knife, which I felt I never could use again.</p>

<p>I looked out of the hut and perceived two of the slaves, who
performed that office, coming towards me to take away the body.
I desired them to carry it leaving the clothes on, followed them,
and saw it deposited in the earth; after which I read prayers over
the grave and could not refrain from shedding many tears to the
memory of my faithful associate. I then returned to the hut, and
taking the pan of water in my hand went to my own abode. I
could not bear to touch the diamond, but I dared not leave it
where it was; so I poured all the water out of the pan, and then
rolled the diamond out on the floor, which was of hardened clay.
I saw at once that it was one of great value, weighing, I should
think, thirteen or fourteen <em>grammes</em>, and of a very pure water.
It was in the form of an obtuse octoh&aelig;dron, and on one side was
quite smooth and transparent. Having made this examination,
I picked up some of the clay with a piece of iron, and rolling the
diamond into the hole, I jammed the clay down over it. &ldquo;There,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;you may remain till doomsday, or till some one finds
you; you will be of no use to me;&rdquo; and I thought of the cock in
the fable. My tattered Bible caught my eye, and I said to it,
&ldquo;You are of more value than all the diamonds in the world;&rdquo; and
I only uttered what I felt.</p>

<p>For a long time I mourned for Ingram, and thought nothing
of the diamond. Three months more passed away, and I had
been eighteen months in the mines, when some visitors made
their appearance&mdash;no less than one of the principals of the Jesuit
order, who had been sent by the king of Portugal out to the
Brazils, on a tour of inspection, as it was called, but in fact to
examine into the state of affairs, and the way in which the government
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
revenue was collected. There had lately been so much
peculation on the part of the various officers, that it was considered
necessary to make minute inquiry. A Portuguese nobleman
had been sent out the year before, but had died shortly after
his arrival, and there was every reason to suppose that he had
been poisoned, that the inquiry might be got rid of. Now this
Jesuit priest had been sent out, probably because a Portuguese,
who thought little of poisoning and stabbing a layman, would not
dare to attempt the life of so sacred a character. Having full and
extraordinary powers, he had made a short inquiry into the
different departments of government, and had now come to the
mines to ascertain how far the delivery of the diamonds at the
treasury agreed with the collection at the mines; for these mines
had usually produced from a million to a million and a half of
revenue. The director was in a great fuss when he heard of this
arrival at the further barrier; although immediately announced to
him, he had scarcely an hour to prepare before the superior of
the Jesuits arrived with his suite, consisting of about twenty
people, and fifty or sixty sumpter mules and riding-horses. We
were all called out to receive him, that is, all the inspectors. I
went to attend the parade, and awaited with much indifference;
but my feelings were soon changed, when in this superior of the
Jesuits I beheld the Catholic priest who had visited me in the
Tower and obtained my release. The superior bowed to the
director and to all around him, and as he then looked at us all,
he recognized me immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You here, my son?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, holy father,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and I thank Heaven that
your arrival will enable me to prove my innocence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray how is this?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>In a few words I narrated my story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were thrown into prison without being permitted to
defend yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so, good father, and sent to the mines to slave for
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not make known your case to the director of the
mines?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
&ldquo;I did, Sir, but he stated that he pitied me, but could not
help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the case, Mr. Director?&rdquo; said the Jesuit, severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, Sir,&rdquo; replied the director; &ldquo;I have more than once
reported cases of what appeared to me great hardship, if what
those condemned have said was true, and have been told that I
was too officious, and that there could be no reversal of sentence.
I can prove to you, Sir, by my journals and letter-books how
many cases I did formerly attempt to bring before the government;
but I at last received such replies, which I can show you,
as will prove that there has been no fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me to add, holy father,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the kindness
and consideration of the director have been very great to all those
under his charge, and I think it very fortunate that such a person
has been appointed to this situation, as he has done every thing
that has been in his power to alleviate the miseries of bondage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so, Mr. Elrington; Mr. Director,
this gentleman is a dear friend of mine, let him instantly be
released. My orders are not to be disputed by the viceroy himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The superior then embraced me cordially, and told me that I
was free, and should return with him to Rio. Imagine, my dear
Madam, my joy and gratitude. I fell on my knees before him,
and kissed his hands. He gave me his blessing, and raised
me up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your companion in misfortune?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! Sir, he is dead,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>The superior shook his head and turned away, saying, &ldquo;I will
search into this affair to the bottom, depend upon it, when I get
back to Rio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then desired the director to bring out his books, and his
own secretary to follow him, leaving his servants in the court-yard
with me and the other inspectors. I received the congratulations
of all parties present, and as soon as possible I escaped
from them, and returned to my own room, where I knelt and
fervently thanked God for my unexpected deliverance; and having
paid my duty to the Most High, I sat down, and fell into a most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
delightful reverie of anticipations. In the evening, after the
superior had dismissed him, the director sent for me, and
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me to return you many thanks for your kindness in
speaking so favourably of me as you have done. You have, indeed,
been of service to me, and I am most grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only did you justice, director,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how few have justice done them in this world,&rdquo;
replied he. &ldquo;The superior desired me to tell you, that you are
to live with the gentlemen of his suite. Of course, you know, it
is not etiquette for him to admit any body to his table. At all
events you must allow me one pleasure, which is to supply you
with clothes proper to your appearance, which I can easily do
without inconvenience to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The director then led me into his room, and opened a wardrobe
full of rich suits, selected two of the handsomest, with linen
and every other article requisite, a handsome sword and hat, all
of which he begged me to accept. Calling one of his servants,
he ordered him to put them into a valise, and take them to my
apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any thing else that I can do?&mdash;speak freely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, director,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I will accept these things from
you, as I cannot procure them here, but when at Rio, I have
means to obtain every thing that I require. I return you many
thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send my servant to arrange your hair,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and
I pray you to consider him at your disposal during the few days
which the superior may remain here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will take him so long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the director, &ldquo;I will tell you in confidence,
that he has brought with him the produce of the mines accounted
for to the government at home, and on his first inspection has
found such defalcation from that which has been transmitted by
me to Rio, that I expect there will be serious business. They
never imagined at Rio that he would have undertaken such a
tedious journey as he has done, and they are in much alarm about
it; but I will leave you now, that you may go home and make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
your toilet. Allow me to congratulate you, with all my heart, at
the fortunate termination to your unjust bondage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having again thanked him for his kindness, I went to my
lodging, where I found his servant waiting for me; and having
had my hair arranged in a very tolerable manner, and a little
powder thrown in, I put on one of the suits, which fitted me
pretty well, requiring but a slight alteration, from being rather
full, which the servant soon managed. Thus did I once more
appear as a gentleman&mdash;contrary to all my expectations&mdash;and I
then went and joined the suite of the superior, who, when they
perceived the difference which dress made in my appearance,
congratulated me, and warmly welcomed me to join the meal
which had just been prepared for them. On the following day,
the superior sent for me, and ordering me to sit down, requested
that I would enter into full detail of what had happened to me
since we last parted. I did so, and my narrative occupied the
whole afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your life has been full of vicissitude,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;I trust,
however, that your adventures are now over, and that you will
be restored to your friends: the service you performed for our
cause will never be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ventured to ask him how it was that he was now in the employ
of the King of Portugal? He replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an Irishman by birth, and educated at St. Omers. I
was first sent to Spain by the order when I was young, and have
since been employed all over the world in the advancement of our
holy church. Country with our order is of no consequence. We
all serve the holy church, and go wherever our services are required.
I would you were a Catholic, I could advance you beyond
all your hopes; but you are engaged to be married, and that puts
an end to the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I thought the holy father must be tired with our long conference,
I rose and took my leave.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards I was informed by him that he intended
to set off on his return to Rio, and now I thought of the diamond,
which I resolved to carry with me. I had no fear of being searched
while under this excellent superior&rsquo;s protection, and therefore I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
went to my lodging, dug up the diamond, and having washed it,
for the first time gave it the examination which it deserved. It
certainly was a stone of great value, but of what value I could not
exactly say. From what I had learnt from the director, who
usually put his idea of the value upon any diamond of size which
was brought to him, I considered that 20,000<i>l.</i> was the least
which could be put upon the stone. I took the precaution not to
carry it loose in my pocket, but to sew it within the lining of my
clothes. Glad I was, indeed, when the orders to start the next
morning were given out. I found that a horse was appointed for
me, and having made up my valise, not forgetting my tattered
Bible, I went to my bed, thanking God that this was to be the
last night that I was to pass in the accursed Sierra de Espinha&ccedil;o.</p>

<p>At daylight the superior took his leave, mounted his mule,
and we set forth, passing the guard-house in the narrow road,
which I never expected to pass again. Before noon we were clear
of the Sierra, and once more in the open country. The attendants,
with a portion of the sumpter mules, went in advance, to
prepare for the superior&rsquo;s arrival at the spot where we were to
halt.</p>

<p>The weather was excessively sultry, and the glare of the sun
was very distressing. At noon we stopped to take our dinner,
and the usual siesta after it. The attendants in advance had
raised a sort of palanquin for the superior, and every thing was
ready. The superior alighted, and sat down under the palanquin,
which protected him from the rays of the sun; we all sat
round at a respectful distance. The heat was so intense, that to
relieve himself, the superior had, when he sat down, thrown off
his long black robe, such as is worn by the priests of his order.
Dinner was served up, and we had a merry party, notwithstanding
the great heat. After our meal, we all shaded ourselves as
well as we could, and took our siesta for about two hours, when
the superior rose up, and gave the signal for resuming our journey.
The horses were soon ready, and the superior&rsquo;s mule being
brought up to the palanquin, he rose up, and one of his attendants
was lifting up his robe for the superior to resume it, when
my eye detected the head of a snake just showing itself out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
side-pocket of the robe in which he carried his breviary and his
handkerchief. I knew the snake well, for we often found them
in the Sierra de Espinha&ccedil;o, and some two or three of the slaves
had lost their lives by their bite, which was so fatal, that they
died in less than five minutes afterwards. The superior had his
handkerchief in his hand, and would have undoubtedly put it in
his pocket before he mounted his mule, and if so, would certainly
have been bitten, and lost his life. As the superior was
fastening his robe at the throat, I darted forward, seized it,
threw it on the ground, and commenced stamping upon it with
all my force, much to the surprise of the whole party. Some of
them thought me mad, and others, who were horrified at such
treatment of the holy garment, called out, &ldquo;Heretico maldetto!&rdquo;
which, Madam, you must know, means, accursed heretic.
Having felt the snake (which is very short, but very thick in the
body, with a head like a toad) several times moving under my
feet, and then moving no more, I then stepped off the garment,
and turning it over, I lifted it up by the skirt, so that the dead
snake rolled out of the pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank the God whom we all worship, and the Son of God,
who died for us all, whether Catholic or Heretic,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that
I have been the means of preserving our holy father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had knelt down as I thus prayed, and the superior, perceiving
the danger that he had been in, did the same, and silently
returned his thanks; at his example all the rest went down on
their knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the superior; &ldquo;would to God that instead of
reviling each other, all denominations of Christians would join
in thus bruising the head of the serpent which seeks our spiritual
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then rose and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, I thank thee for the kind service thou hast performed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then explained to the superior the deadly nature of the animal,
and my fear that he would have put his handkerchief in the
pocket of his robe before I had time to prevent him, and begged
him to excuse my seeming abruptness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
&ldquo;There needs no apology for saving a man&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; replied he,
smiling.&mdash;&ldquo;Come, let us go forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hardly need say that we were not quite so long in returning
to Rio as we were in going to the mines. We accomplished our
journey, without using extreme haste, in about half of the time.
On our arrival, we took up our quarters at a magnificent palace,
which had been appropriated to the superior during his residence
at Rio, and I found myself sumptuously lodged. For some days,
during which the superior had frequent interviews with the viceroy,
I did not see him, but one day I was summoned to his pretence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have lost no time in investigating
your affair, and I find that all you have said is quite correct. To
the disgrace of the government here, and the manner in which
justice is administered, it appears that this man, Olivarez, on
his arrival, went to the secretary of the judge of that court in
which such offences are tried, and stated that he had two English
mutineers on board, who had attempted to take the vessel, and
wounded several of his men dangerously; that he wished, of
course, to deliver them up to justice, but that the immediate
departure of his vessel would be prevented by so doing, as his
crew would be required as evidence; that the delay would be very
disadvantageous; and he inquired whether it could not be managed
that these men might be punished without the appearance
of himself and his men, as he would pay a good sum rather than
be detained. The secretary perfectly understood the trick, and
upon the receipt of five hundred cruzados, he accepted the deposition
of Olivarez, sworn to by him, as sufficient evidence, and
you were consigned to the mines upon this deposition by a warrant
from the judge. We have had some trouble to obtain all the
facts, but the question has been severely applied, and has
elicited them. Now, first, as to the judge and his secretary, they
have gone to the gaol, and will take your place in the mines for
life. Next as to Olivarez. It appears that, on his arrival, he
sold his cargo of slaves very advantageously; that having received
the money, he gave a small portion to each of his men, and that
they went on shore, and, like all English seamen, were soon in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
a state of intoxication; that Olivarez took such steps with the
police, as to have them all thrown into prison when in that state;
and, on the following morning, he went to them, persuaded
them that they had committed themselves during their intoxication,
and that it required a large sum to free them. This he pretended
to have paid for them, and having purchased a cargo for
his voyage, he got them all on board, and again ran for the
coast of Africa. In three months he returned with another cargo,
which he sold. He had found out his mother, and now he expended
the money he had made in purchasing a good property
about seven miles from Rio, where he placed his mother and
some slaves to take care of it, and cultivate it. He contrived to
defraud his crew as much as he could, and before he went to the
coast again, he married an amiable young person, the daughter
of a neighbour. He made a third and a fourth voyage with equal
success, but on the third voyage he contrived to get rid of a portion
of his English crew, who were now becoming troublesome,
by taking some Portuguese sailors out with him, and leaving the
English on the coast, as if by mistake. Previous to the fourth
voyage, it appears that he satisfied the remainder of the English
crew by producing accounts, and sharing out to them several
hundred dollars previous to their departure for the coast. He
made a slight addition to his Portuguese sailors, not putting too
many on board, to avoid suspicion, and when on the coast of
Africa, a portion of the English crew died; whether by poison or
not is not known, and the others he put on shore, seizing all
their property, and the dollars with which he had satisfied them.
On his return from his fourth voyage, having now nothing to fear
from the partners in his atrocious deed, having realized a large
sum, he determined to remain on shore altogether, and live on
his property with his mother and wife. He did so, and sent out
the schooner under a Portuguese captain and crew, to be employed
for him as owner in the slave traffic, and she has made
two voyages since, and is expected back again every day. Now,
my son, retribution has fallen heavily upon this bad man. Had
he been discovered and punished when he first did the deed, it
would have been as nothing compared to what it has been now;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
he then had no property&mdash;no ties&mdash;in fact, nothing or little to
regret; but now, with a wife and child, with a valuable property,
living in independence, and increasing that wealth daily&mdash;now,
when he is at the very summit of his ambition, restored to his
own country, respected and considered as being a man of wealth,
he has been seized, thrown into a dungeon, put to the question,
and now lies in a state of misery, awaiting the sentence of death
which has been pronounced against him. Neither has he the
consolation of knowing that he leaves those whom he loves in a
state of affluence, for all his property, having been gained by
making use of your property, necessarily is your property, and
not his, and it has been confiscated accordingly for your use and
benefit. As soon as every thing is collected, it will be paid into
your hands. Thus, my son, I have at last attained justice for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was, as you may imagine, my dear Madam, profuse in my
acknowledgments, but he stopped me, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sent here to see that justice was done to every body,
if I possibly could&mdash;no easy task, when all are amassing money,
not caring how they obtain it; but, surely, if any one has peculiar
claims upon me, it is you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The superior then asked me many questions relative to my
parentage, and I did not conceal any thing from him. I told
who I was, and why, at an early age, I had left my father&rsquo;s
house. He asked me many questions, and, after about two
hours&rsquo; conversation, he dismissed me, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may always depend upon my protection and gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he dismissed me, he told me that he was about to send
a despatch-boat to Lisbon, and as I might wish to inform my
friends of my safety, if I would write letters, he would insure
their being safely delivered to my friends in England. I gladly
availed myself of this offer, and indeed would have begged a
passage for myself, if it had not been that I considered Olivarez&rsquo;s
money to be the property of Mr. Trevannion, and was determined
to remit it to him before I left Rio. This detained me about six
weeks longer, during which interval Olivarez had suffered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
penalty due to his crimes, having been strangled in the market-place.</p>

<p>The money received was 28,000 cruzados, and not knowing
how to dispose of it, I applied to the superior, who gave me
orders for it in duplicates upon the treasury at Lisbon, one of
which I had very soon an opportunity of sending home to Mr.
Trevannion, with a duplicate of my first letter, and a second to
him and Amy, stating my intention of returning as soon as possible.
But this was by a Portuguese frigate, which made a very
circuitous route home, and I did not choose to go by that conveyance,
as her detention at the different ports was so uncertain.
At last I became very impatient for my departure, and anxiously
awaited the sailing of some vessel to any port of Europe.</p>

<p>I had reserved 1,000 cruzados for my own expenses, which
I considered as quite sufficient, but they were gradually wasting
away, for I was everywhere received, and in the best company
of Rio. At last one day the superior sent for me, and told me
that he was about to send an advice-boat to Lisbon, and I might
take a passage if I wished; that it was a very small one, but a
very fast sailer. I thanked him heartily, accepted the proposal,
and went to my room to pack up my clothes. In the afternoon
the captain of the xebeque called upon me, and told me that he
would start on the following morning if I would be ready. I replied
that I should be, put some dollars into his hands, requesting
that he would procure for me any thing that he considered
would be necessary and agreeable, and if the sum I had
given him was not enough, I would repay him the remainder as
soon as we were out of harbour. I took my leave of the superior,
who parted with me with many protestations of regard on his side,
and tears of gratitude on mine, and early the next morning I was
on board of the xebeque. In light winds she was extremely fast,
but she certainly was too small to cross the Atlantic Ocean;
nevertheless, as the captain said, she had crossed it several
times, and he hoped that she often would again.</p>

<p>The passage, however, that he usually made, was to run up
to the northward of the Antilles, and then cross over, making
the Bahama Isles, and from thence taking a fresh departure for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
Lisbon. Our crew consisted of only eight men, besides the
captain; but as the vessel was not more than thirty tons, they
were sufficient. We made a good run, until we were in about
twenty-four degrees of north latitude, when, as we stretched to
the eastward to cross the Atlantic, we met with a most violent
gale, which lasted several days, and I fully expected every hour
that the vessel would go down, buried as she was by the heavy
sea. At last we had no chance but to scud before the wind,
which we did for two days before a raging and following sea, that
appeared determined upon our destruction. On the second night,
as I was on deck, watching the breaking and tossing of the
billows, and the swift career of the little bark, which enabled
her to avoid them, the water suddenly appeared of one white
foam, and as we rose upon the next sea, we were hurled along
on its crest, reeling on the foam until it had passed us, and
then we struck heavily upon a rock. Fortunately, it was a soft
coral rock, or we had all perished. The next wave lifted us up
again, and threw us further on, and, on its receding, the little
xebeque laid high and dry, and careened over on her bilge.</p>

<p>The waters rose and fell, and roared and foamed about us,
but they lifted us no more, neither did they wash us off the decks
as we clung to the rigging; for the stout short mast, upon which
the lateen sail was hoisted, had not been carried away. We remained
where we were till morning, every one holding on, and
not communicating with each other. As the night wore away, so
did the gale decrease and the sea subside. The waters now gradually
left us; at intervals, when the waves receded, we could
walk on shore; but we remained on the vessel till noon, by
which time we found our vessel high and dry, having been
carried over a coral reef, which appeared to extend one or two
miles into the offing.</p>

<p>The men, who had been much buffeted by the waves, and
who were exhausted by clinging so long to the rigging, now that
they found themselves safe, and were warmed by the heat of the
sun, rallied, and began to move about. We had a long consultation
as to how we should act. There was no chance of getting
the vessel off again, and we did not exactly know where we were;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
but the captain and I agreed that it must be upon one of the small
islands of the Bahama group that we had been cast away, and
our conjecture was right. After some consultation, the captain
and I called the men together, and told them that it was very probable
that we might be some time before we could find the means
of getting off the island, and that, therefore, we must all do
our best; that we would land and erect a tent with the sails, and
obtain provisions; after that we would consider the vessel and
her stores as public property, but that every man&rsquo;s private property
should be secured to him as if we were still on board of the
xebeque; that the captain should retain the command as before,
and his orders should be obeyed by every body, as long as they
were reasonable and just.</p>

<p>The men, who were well-behaved, quiet fellows&mdash;and not,
like English seamen, given to liquor&mdash;readily agreed, and it
was arranged that the following morning we should commence
our labours. This was a sad blow to me, who was anticipating
a speedy meeting with Amy. I knew how doubtful was the
chance of our being seen by any vessel, and that I must remain
here for months, if not longer&mdash;but I had been schooled, and
could now say with fervency, &ldquo;Thy will, oh Lord, and not mine,
be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We remained on board of the vessel that night, and the next
morning the gale had ceased, and the waters, to our astonishment,
had receded, so as to leave us at least sixty yards from the
sea, which was now almost calm. We first took a survey of the
island, to ascertain if there was any water, and, as the island was
not more than two miles in circumference, this did not take us
long. Fortunately, in the centre we found a deep hole sunk in
the soft coral rock by some other people who had been wrecked
here, and in the hole the water was, although a little brackish,
somewhat palatable. It evidently was the sea-water filtered
through the soft rock.</p>

<p>The whole of the island was surrounded with coral reefs,
with lanes of deep water running between them, and the fish were
sporting in thousands after the storm, but there was not a tree or
vestige of vegetation upon the whole island. We soon, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
discovered that it was frequented by turtle, for we found some
eggs, fresh-buried, in the sand. Having made this survey, we
then went back to the vessel, and with spars and sails rigged a
tent upon the highest point of the island, which might be ten or
fifteen feet above the level of the sea. The tent was large enough
to hold fifty men, if required, so we brought our bedding and
chests and all our cooking apparatus on shore, made a fire-place
outside the tent with the little cabouse we had on board of the
vessel, sent a man to obtain water from the hole, and put on some
meat to boil for our dinners. In the evening we all went out to
turn turtle, and succeeded in turning three, when we decided
that we would not capture any more until we had made a turtle-pond
to put them in, for we had not more than two months&rsquo; provisions
on board of the vessel, and did not know how long we
might be detained. The men behaved very well, and indeed
seemed determined to make themselves as comfortable as they
could under existing circumstances. The next day we put out
some lines in deep water, and caught several large fish, and then
we went to find a proper spot for a turtle-pond. We selected a
hole in the reef which we thought would answer, as we had only
one end of it to fill up, and we commenced breaking away the
rock with crowbars, and worked hard the whole of the day, some
breaking and others carrying the masses broken off. By degrees
they rose to the surface of the water, and in two days more we
calculated that the pond would be ready to receive the turtle.
We had killed one turtle in the morning, and we now lived upon
it altogether, as we wished to save our salt provisions. The captain
and I had many consultations as to what we should do, and
what attempts we should make to get off from this spot. Build
a boat we could not, as we had not a carpenter among us, or the
means of making the iron-work necessary. We had some tools,
such as are usually used on board of vessels, and several pounds
of large nails, but none fit for boat-building. I proposed that
we should examine the bottom of the xebeque, and see what damage
was done to it. We did so, and found that the garboard
streak was broken and two of her timbers, but they were easy to
repair; in every other respect she was sound. I then proposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
that we should cut down the xebeque to a large boat, which we
could easily do by ripping off her planks and decks, and sawing
down her timbers to the height we required. It would be a heavy
boat, it was true, but we should be able to launch her with rollers,
and the draught of water would be so small that we could get
her over the reefs, which we could not possibly do the xebeque.
The captain approved of the idea, and we agreed that as soon as
the turtle-pond was finished we would make the attempt. In
two days more we had finished the pond, and had turned thirty
turtle, which we put into it. The men, now that they found that
they had plenty to eat, began to show signs of laziness, and did
not very readily commence the work upon the xebeque. They
ate and slept, ate and slept again, on the mattresses spread in the
tent. At times they would fish, but it was with difficulty that the
captain and I could persuade them to work, and if they did work
half an hour, they then threw down their axes and crowbars, and
went back to the tent. They had plenty of tobacco, and they
smoked half the day, ate turtle, and then slept again. Nevertheless,
as the captain and I worked hard, the work progressed; in
about ten days after we began the work, we had ripped off her
decks and her side-planks as low as we thought right, and we
were now sawing through the timbers, when the quiet of our
party was disturbed by what may be considered a very strange
quarrel. One of the men asserted in conversation that St. Antony
was born in Padua; one or two of the other seamen denied
it, and this difference of opinion, which at first was a mere nothing,
from sullenness, I presume, and something being required
to excite them, in the course of a day or two ended in a
serious feud; the Paduans terming the anti-Paduans heretics and
Jews. The epithet of Jew was what irritated so much, and the
parties being exactly even, four on each side, on the third day,
after an angry altercation, they all rushed out of the tent to decide
the affair with their knives. The conflict was very fierce, and
took place when the captain and I were at the xebeque, and before
we could separate them, four of them had fallen; two were killed,
and the other two badly wounded. It may appear ridiculous that
people should take each other&rsquo;s lives for such a trifle; but, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
all, nations declare war against each other, and thousands are
killed on both sides for causes almost as slight. With great difficulty
we separated the remaining combatants, and such was
their rage and excitement, that every now and then they would
attempt to break from us and attack each other again; but at last
we disarmed them.</p>

<p>This was a sad business; and it was melancholy to think that
companions in misfortune should take each other&rsquo;s lives, instead
of feeling grateful to the Almighty for their preservation.</p>

<p>We buried the two men who had fallen, and dressed the
wounds of the hurt; but after this quarrel the four others came
to their work, and continued steady at it. We had now removed
the upper portion of the xebeque, and commenced fixing beams
and carlines on the lower part, so as to make a decked boat of it,
and in another week we had decked her over. But we had a great
deal more to do: we had to reduce the mast and yard to a proper
size, to alter the sail and rigging, to make a small rudder, and
rollers to launch her upon. All this, with our reduced force,
occupied us another month; for the two wounded men, although
recovering, could but just crawl about. We turned many more
turtle at night, that we might have a sufficient supply. We now
looked out for a channel of deep water through the reef, to get
our boat out, and made one out to a certain extent, but could
not survey further without getting off the reef, and the sharks
were so numerous that we dared not venture. However, we took
it for granted, as we had found deep water in shore, that we
should be sure to do so in the offing; and we now got our boat
upon the rollers which we had made, by digging away the sand
from beneath her, and a trench to the water&rsquo;s edge. We had
been two months on the island when all was ready for launching.</p>

<p>Anxious as I was to return to England, I cannot say that I was
unhappy when on this island: there was always a fine sea-breeze,
which cooled the air, and enabled us to work without exhaustion.
With the exception of the unfortunate quarrel I have referred to,
every thing went on quietly. After work was over, I resorted as
usual to my Bible, and read for hours; and this calmed and
allayed any impatient feelings which might at times arise. I felt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
that I had great cause to be grateful to the Almighty for preserving
me as he had done, and that it would be folly and wickedness
on my part to repine because I could not obtain all that I
wished. I waited, therefore, for His own good time, without
murmuring, and in full confidence that all was for the best.</p>

<p>At last we contrived to get our boat into the water, and she
floated much lighter than we thought she would have done, considering
the weight of wood that was in her. As soon as she was
anchored about ten feet from the beach, we made a gangway to
her with planks, and commenced getting all our salt provisions,
water, and stores, which we had selected as most necessary, on
board of her. The stowage of these occupied us two days; we
then got the yard up and bent the sail, and having fitted oars, we
determined that the next day we would embark. As she still
swam light, we got on board of her as many turtle as we could
conveniently carry, and then, for the last time, went onshore
to sleep.</p>

<p>As there was no room for our chests, it was agreed that we
each should have a bundle on board, selecting those things which
we most required and most valued. This proposal, which was
made by the captain, put me in mind of the diamond, which had
scarcely once entered my thoughts since I had been on the island.
When I took it out of my chest, I thought that I might as well
make it more convenient to carry, as there was no saying what
might be the result of our new expedition; so, when the other
men were all busy about their own effects, or asleep, I first took
the precaution to roll it up in a covering of pitch, so that, if taken
from me or lost, it might not be known to be a diamond, and
then I sewed it up in a piece of leather, which I cut from an old
glove, putting a strong leather lanyard to it, so that I might
wear it round my neck. Having done this without any one taking
notice, and having nothing else to do, I took some fine twine,
and worked it over, like the mousing of a stay, in a way peculiar
to sailors, so that, when finished, it was very much in the shape
of a miniature buoy to an anchor, and reminded me of a <em>fend-off</em>,
or fender, such as they use to prevent any injury to the sides of a
vessel when coming in contact with another. Having finished

my work, I put the leather lanyard round my neck, inside of
my shirt, so that my diamond was concealed from sight; I then
put up my remaining pieces-of-eight&mdash;which were nearly 500,
the best of my clothes (for during my stay at Rio I had very much
increased my stock), and I hardly need say that the old Bible
was not left behind.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, calm morning when we embarked, and,
lifting the anchor, took to our oars, and pulled out through the
deep channel, the captain standing at the bow and conning us
through, while I took the helm. The boat pulled well and steered
well; we had yet to see what she could do under canvas. After
a pull of two hours we were clear of the reef, and out in the open
sea. We then laid in the oars, and commenced our preparations
for hoisting the sail to a breeze, which then blew from the southward.
When all was ready, the men hoisted the sail, but in so
doing, a rope being foul, as I was attempting to clear it, I was
tripped up, and fell with my right knee on a spike, which entered
deep, putting me to excruciating pain, and laming me completely.
I was obliged to sit down abaft, for I nearly fainted
away. In the mean time the sail was set, and the boat stood well
up to it. She proved to be very stiff under canvas, which was a
source of great congratulation. My knee became so painful and
stiff that I could not move it; I took one of my shirts out of my
bundle, tore it up into bandages, and put them on. We had resolved
to attempt to make New Providence, the largest of the
Bahama group, where we knew that there was a town called Nassau,
and from whence we hoped to obtain some conveyance to
Europe; but we knew nothing of the port, or the inhabitants, or
what trade was carried on with them.</p>

<p>For several hours our little bark went gaily over the water, but
towards nightfall the wind shifted, and the weather looked
threatening. We hardly knew how to steer, as we did not know
the position of the island which we had left, and now the wind
heading us, we hauled up on the larboard tack, with our head to
the northward and eastward. As the sun went down, the wind
increased, and the sea ran fast. Our boat behaved well, till it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
began to blow very hard, and then it took in so much water, that
we were forced to bale.</p>

<p>We had reefed our sail, and made every thing as snug as we
could, but the sea rising fast, and the boat taking in more water,
we considered it prudent to lighten her, which we did by throwing
overboard all the turtle. This we did without regret, as we
were tired of eating them for so long a while. The day broke, and
there appeared every sign of bad weather, and the waves now
tossed and foamed too much for such a small craft as we were in.
About noon we saw a vessel on a wind to leeward of us, which
was a source of great delight to us all, and we bore down to her.
We soon made her out to be an hermaphrodite brig, under her
close-reefed topsails and trysails. We ran under her counter and
hailed. We perceived several men standing abaft, and apparently
they suspected us for a rover, for they had muskets and
other weapons in their hands. We told them that we had been
shipwrecked, and the boat was sinking in the gale, and then we
rounded to under her lee.</p>

<p>There we remained for four or five hours, during which the
wind and the sea went down very fast, and the boat no longer
took in water; but we had been all too much alarmed with the
danger in which we had been, to like to continue our voyage in
her, and as we thought that we could now go alongside with
safety, we hailed again, and asked permission. After some
parleying, they threw us a rope, which we made fast to the boat,
and lowered our sail, keeping off on a broad sheer, as there still
was a great deal of sea. They then entered into conversation with
us. I told them all that had happened, and inquired where the
brig was bound to.</p>

<p>They replied, to James Town, Virginia. I asked them if
they could give us a passage there, as we were afraid to proceed
in our boat; or if not, would they see us safe into New Providence.</p>

<p>The captain then came forward. He was a very dark man,
dark as a mulatto, with keen small eyes, and a hooked nose. I
never beheld a more deformed and repulsive countenance.</p>

<p>He said, that he could not go to New Providence, as it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
out of his way, and that we might easily get there ourselves if we
thought proper.</p>

<p>I replied, that the boat was not sufficiently large and seaworthy,
and that we had already nearly gone down, and if another
gale should come on, we certainly should founder, and
again requested that he would take us on board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any money to pay for your passage?&rdquo; inquired he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;common charity and the feelings of a seaman
towards sailors in distress should be sufficient to induce you
to take us on board, and not leave us to perish; but if you require
money,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;we have more than sufficient to satisfy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; screamed out a lad of about fourteen, who
was the very image of the captain in miniature.</p>

<p>I did not reply to this question, and the captain then said,
&ldquo;What do you propose to do with the boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go adrift, to be sure,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got on board of her?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>I enumerated, as well as I could recollect, the provisions and
stores that we had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I will wait till it is a little smoother,
and then we will clear the boat and take you on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then left the gangway, where he had been standing, and
we continued to be towed by the brig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like that fellow,&rdquo; said I to the Portuguese captain;
&ldquo;he appears, or pretends, to take us for pirates, but he is more
like a pirate himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks like the devil himself,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;and
to ask people in our condition to pay for their passage! He is a
monster! However, we all have a few doubloons, thank Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About an hour afterwards, it being much more moderate, the
captain of the brig told us to sheer alongside, and that four of us
might come out and the others remain in the boat till she was
cleared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had better go,&rdquo; said I to the captain, &ldquo;for with
so much motion I never shall be able to get up the side with my
bad knee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We then sheered the boat alongside, and the captain and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
three of our men got on board, but not without difficulty. I saw
them go aft and down below with the captain of the brig, but I
never saw them on deck again, much to my surprise, although
we were more than half an hour before they again hailed us, and
told us to come alongside again. During this half-hour my mind
misgave me sadly that all was not right, from not seeing the Portuguese
captain, or either of the three men, and I took it into my
head that the vessel was a pirate; and I knew if such was the
case, we should instantly be rifled, if not murdered. I took the
precaution of taking off the bandage from my knee, and having
removed the diamond from my neck, I put it under my ham in the
cavity, which held it with ease, and then put the bandage on
again over it, as I thought they would hardly take a bandage off a
bad knee to see if there was any thing concealed beneath it. It
was with difficulty that I contrived to get on board the brig, and
as soon as I had gained the deck, I was ordered to go down into
the cabin; as I went aft, I looked round for the Portuguese captain
and the men, but could not see them. I contrived, with
difficulty, to get down into the cabin, and as soon as I was there
I was seized by the arms and held fast by two of the men, while
others bound me with seizings.</p>

<p>As the captain was looking on, I inquired into the cause of
this outrage. He replied, that we were a parcel of rascally pirates,
who would have taken his vessel if he had not been too deep for
us; I told him it was false, and that I could easily prove it, as
we still had the despatches on board with which we had been
charged, and that I could show full proof that I was the same
person that I stated myself to be; that I very much feared that we
had fallen into the hands of pirates ourselves, but that I would
have justice done as soon as we arrived at James Town, without
he intended to murder us all before we arrived. His answer was,
that he was too old a bird to be caught with such chaff, and that
he would secure us and deliver us up to the authorities as soon as
he arrived. I replied, in great anger, that he would then be
convinced of his error, if it was an error, on his part; that his
conduct was infamous, and he looked like a scoundrel, and I
believed him to be one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
&ldquo;You call me a scoundrel, do you,&rdquo; said he, levelling a
pistol at my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call us scoundrels, do you,&rdquo; cried the boy I have made
mention of, and who was evidently the son of the captain, taking
up another pistol in his hand. &ldquo;Shall I shoot him, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Peleg; not yet; we will pay them all when we get in.
Take him away, and put him in irons with the rest,&rdquo; said the
captain; and I was immediately dragged forward between decks
through a door in the bulk-heads, where I found the Portuguese
captain and three seamen already in irons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is pretty treatment,&rdquo; said he to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, indeed,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but I will make him
smart for it when we arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we ever arrive?&rdquo; said the Portuguese captain, looking
at me and compressing his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, my man,&rdquo; said I to the seaman who stood over us
with a pistol and a cutlass, &ldquo;who are you; and what are you?
Tell us the truth: are you pirates?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never was yet,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;nor do I mean to be; but
our skipper says that you are, and that he knew you as soon as
you came alongside. That&rsquo;s all I can say about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if we are pirates, as he says, and he recognizes us,
he must have been in pirates&rsquo; company, that is clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; he may have been, for all I know,&rdquo; replied the man.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider him any very great things; but he is our captain,
and we must obey orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man now brought forward the other three men who had
been left in the boat. They told us that the boat had been cleared;
all the provisions, stores, sails, &amp;c. had been taken out of her;&mdash;a
proof that she had been gutted and then cut adrift;&mdash;that all
our bundles were down in the captain&rsquo;s cabin, and that the ill-looking
urchin, his son, had overhauled them, one after another,
and handed to his father all the money that he had found; that
they had been searched very carefully; and that they had heard
the captain say that we were all to be sent up, one by one, and
searched in the same manner;&mdash;and so it proved. I was first
taken aft to have my pockets rummaged by the little villain, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
as soon as I had been led forward and again put into irons, the
Portuguese captain and three other seamen were sent for and
treated in the same way. We inquired of the men what money
they had in their bundles and about their persons. They had
each man four doubloons at Rio for wages, and the captain had
about forty doubloons. I had five hundred pieces-of-eight: so
that, altogether, we had been robbed to the tune of about four
hundred pounds sterling, independent of our clothes, which
were of some value to us; that is, mine were, at all events.</p>

<p>The seamen who guarded us, and who relieved each other
every watch, were not at all surly or ill-natured. I asked one
of them during the night watch whether he thought the captain
would take our lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will not allow that. You may be pirates,
as he says, although we do not think you are; but if pirates, you
shall have fair play; that we have all made up our minds to. No hanging
first, and trying afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had a long conversation with this man, who appeared very
much inclined to be sociable. He told me that the vessel was
named the <i>Transcendant</i>; that she sailed from Virginia to the
West Indies, and that sometimes she went to England; that the
captain of her was also the owner, but where he came from, or
what he was, they did not know, except that he was a Virginian,&mdash;they
believed so, for that he had a tobacco estate there, which
was carried on by his eldest son. He called the captain a stingy,
miserly fellow, who would sacrifice any man&rsquo;s life to save a
shilling, and that there were odd stories about him at James
Town.</p>

<p>I was well satisfied with my conversation with this man, as it
assured me that our lives would not be taken, and I had no fear
of the result upon my arrival at James Town, for, as I have
mentioned before, Mr. Trevannion had vessels which sailed to
that port, and I well recollected the names of the parties to
whom the vessel and cargo were consigned.</p>

<p>On the following day the captain of the brig, followed by his
ill-favoured son, came forward and looked at us as we sat in
irons, upon which I addressed him,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
&ldquo;You have put me in irons, Sir, when I threw myself upon
your protection. You have robbed us of our money to the amount
of nearly 400<i>l.</i>, and you detain our other property. I now again
desire that I may be released. I offered to convince you that I
was a person of property, but you refused to listen to me. Now,
Sir, I will tell you that I am a partner in the house of Trevannion,
at Liverpool, and that we have vessels that trade between James
Town and that port. Our vessels are consigned to Messrs. Fairbrother
and Wilcocks, of James Town, and on my arrival I will
soon prove that to you; and also not only make you surrender the
property you have robbed us of, but I will make you smart pretty
handsomely for your treatment of us, that you may depend
upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairbrother and Wilcocks,&rdquo; muttered he; &ldquo;confound the
fellow. Oh,&rdquo; said he, turning to me, &ldquo;you got the name of
that firm from some ship you have plundered and sunk, I suppose.
No, no, that won&rsquo;t do, old birds are not to be caught
with chaff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you to have been a pirate yourself, if you are not
one now,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;at all events you are a thief and a paltry
villain&mdash;but our time will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will,&rdquo; said the captain of the xebeque, &ldquo;and remember,
you scoundrel, if you can escape and buy off justice,
you shall not escape seven Portuguese knives, mind you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the Portuguese sailors; &ldquo;stop till we are
on shore, and then come on shore if you dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, father,&rdquo; said young Hopeful, &ldquo;this looks like mischief;
better hang them, I reckon, than to be stuck like pigs.
They look as if they&rsquo;d do it, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shall never forget the diabolical expression of the captain
of the brig after the Portuguese sailors had done speaking. He
had a pistol at his belt, which he drew out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, shoot &rsquo;em, father; dead men tell no tales,
as you have always said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the seaman who was on guard, motioning
them back with his cutlass, &ldquo;there will be no shooting nor
hanging either; we are all sworn to that. If so be they be pirates,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
there&rsquo;s the law of the country to condemn them; and if they be
not pirates, why then that&rsquo;s another story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked at the seaman as if he could have shot him
if he dared. Then turned round hastily and went back to the
cabin, followed by his worthy offspring.</p>

<p>For seven days we remained in irons, when we heard land
announced by the sailors on deck, and the brig&rsquo;s head was put
towards it. At night she was hove to, and the next morning
again stood in, and we perceived that we were in smooth water.
Towards night the anchor was let go, and we asked the guard if
we had arrived at James Town.</p>

<p>He replied, &ldquo;No, but we were in a river on the coast, but
he did not know what river it was nor did any of the crew, nor
could they tell why the captain had anchored there. But they
had seen several canoes with Indians cross the river, but that
there appeared to be no white settlement that they could discover.&rdquo;
The mystery was, however, cleared up on the following
morning. A small boat, which could barely hold eight people,
was lowered from the stern, and hauled up alongside. We were
taken up, one by one, the scoundrel of a captain having first
stripped each of us to our trowsers, not even allowing us a shirt.
We were ordered to get into the boat. As soon as we were all in,
and our weight brought the boat down to her gunnel, two oars
were handed to us, and then the captain of the brig said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you rascally pirates, I might have hanged you all,
and I would have done so, for I know you well. I recollect your
faces when you plundered the &lsquo;Eliza,&rsquo; when I was off Porto
Rico; but if I put you in prison at James Town, I shall have to
wait two or three months until the court sits, and I cannot be
detained for such scoundrels as you; so now you may pull on
shore, and get on how you can. Shove off, directly, or I&rsquo;ll
put a bullet through your brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold fast,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;and let him fire if he dares. You
men belonging to the <i>Transcendant</i>, I call you to witness this
treatment. Your captain has robbed us of a large sum of money,
and now turns us adrift, so as to compel us to land among
savages, who may kill us immediately. I appeal to you, will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
you permit this cruelty and injustice? If you are English, I
conceive you will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was some talk and expostulation with the captain of the
brig, in consequence of what I said; but while it was going on,
the captain&rsquo;s son leaned over the side, and, with his knife, cut
the painter, or rope which held the boat, and as the tide was
running on very strong, in less than half a minute we were a long
way astern of the brig, and drifting fast up the river.</p>

<p>We got out our oars, and attempted to pull for the brig, for
we knew that the seamen were taking our parts; but it was in
vain; the tide ran several miles an hour, and in another minute
or two, with all our exertions, we were nearly a quarter of a mile
astern of her, and the boat was so loaded that we hardly dared
move lest we should upset it. We had, therefore, no option
but to go on shore and take our chance; but when the men were
pulling round for the shore, on reflection I thought that we had
better not land so soon, as the sailors had told us that they had
seen the Indians in their canoes. I therefore recommended that
we should allow the boat to drift up the river with the tide, and
then drift down again when the tide turned, remaining in the
middle of the stream till it was dark, when we would land and make
our way into the woods. My advice was followed; we sat still in
the boat, just keeping her head to the stream with the oars, and,
being without our shirts, the sun scorching and blistering our
backs, till past noon, during which time we must have drifted
nearly twenty miles up the river, which was as broad as the arm
of a sea at the entrance; then the tide turned, and we drifted
back again till it was dusk, when it was again slack water. All
this while we kept a sharp look-out to see if we could perceive
any Indians, but not one was to be seen. I now proposed that
we should take our oars and pull out of the river, as if we had
only gone up on a survey, for the brig had got under weigh, and
had anchored, for want of wind, about four miles off, and the
Indians, if there were any, would suppose that we were returning
to the ship. We did so, and pulled till it was dark, and
were within two miles of the brig, where the flood-tide again
made strong, when we turned the boat&rsquo;s head up the river, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
pulled with the oars to get up as far as we could before we landed.
This we did, suffering much from hunger and thirst, as well as
being confined so long in one position. As my knee was quite
well, I now took off the bandage, and hung my diamond round
my neck as before. I could not help feeling a satisfaction, when
I thought that the thief of a captain little imagined what a mine of
wealth he was losing when he turned me adrift. It was about
midnight when the tide ceased to flow, and we then agreed to
land, and the question then was, whether we should separate or
keep together. After some discussion, we agreed to separate in
twos, and the Portuguese captain and I agreed to keep each other
company. We first pushed the boat into the stream, that she
might drift away, and then, shaking each other by the hand and
bidding adieu, we all started in different directions. For some
time the captain and I threaded the woods in silence, when we
were stopped by a stream of deep water, with such high banks,
that in the dark we did not know how to cross it. We walked by
the side of it for some time to discover a passage, and in so doing,
we at last found ourselves again on the banks of the river, and
our boat lying close to us, having grounded not far from where
we had shoved her off. We tasted the water in the creek, and
found it quite fresh: we had several times tried it on the river,
and found it quite salt from the tide running in. We drank
plentifully, and sat down to recover ourselves, for although we
had not walked more than half an hour, the pushing through the
brushwood was very fatiguing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that this boat will certainly betray us,
and would it not be better to take possession of it again? It will
hold two comfortably, and I think we shall get on as well, if not
better, in a boat than in the woods without compass and without
guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;but what shall we
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us retrace our steps; let us pull again, with the ebb-tide,
for the mouth of the river, and then coast it along shore; we
may arrive at some settlement, if we do not starve by the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will be the best plan; we
must conceal ourselves in the day, and coast along at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We waded into the river, got into the boat, and again pulled
out. The boat being light, now pulled well, and we made good
speed; and at daylight we were clear of the river, and close to a
small island near the mouth of it. Upon this, we agreed to land,
to try if we could procure food, for we were much exhausted, and
also to conceal ourselves from the natives. We ran our little
boat on shore, and concealed her among some bushes which
grew down at the water&rsquo;s edge. We looked well round, but
could see nothing, and we then walked out in search of food; we
found some wild plums, which we eagerly devoured; and going
down again to the beach, where there were some rocks, we found
shell-fish, of which we broke the shells between two stones, and
made a meal of. After our hunger was satisfied, we lay down
under the shelter of the boat, and fell fast asleep. We were so
tired that we did not wake up till it was nearly dark, when we
agreed to start again, and pull along the coast to the northward.
We were just launching our boat, when we perceived a canoe
about three miles off, steering for the mouth of the river to the
island. This stopped us, and we remained in our hiding-place.
The canoe approached, steering directly for the spot where we
lay concealed, and we imagined that they had discovered us.
Such, however, proved not to be the case, for they ran on shore
about fifty yards from us, and hauling up the canoe, they got out
and walked away on land. There were four men, but it was now
too dark to distinguish any more. We remained quiet for a
quarter of an hour, when I proposed that we should embark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever managed a canoe?&rdquo; said the Portuguese captain
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been in one in Africa very often,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but they
are dug-outs, as we call them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have I, and I do not think there is so much difference
between them and these canoes. Can you paddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now observe, the best thing we can
do is to take possession of that canoe; and then we shall get on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
better, for our boat will always attract notice, whereas a canoe
will not; besides, it will prevent these Indians, if they are come
to look for us, which I suspect they have, from following us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are right,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but how shall we manage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this way. You shall shove off our boat and walk by its
side, dragging it up to where the canoe lies; I will go to the
canoe, launch it, and then we will make off with both till we are
too far out to be taken; then, when we have got into the canoe,
we will turn our boat adrift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I agreed to the proposals. We launched our boat very quietly,
and I walked in the water up to my knees, drawing it after me
till I arrived opposite to the canoe. The Portuguese crept on his
hands and knees till he had gained the canoe, pushed her off, and
joined me. We made her fast to the tow-rope of our own boat,
then got into the boat, and pulled away from the island.</p>

<p>We had not gained more than a hundred yards, when the
whiz of an arrow met our ears. The Indians had discovered us,
it was evident. Two or three more arrows came flying by us, but
we had now got well out, and they fell harmless. We continued
to pull till we were half a mile from the island, and then we laid
on our oars. The stars shone bright; there was a young moon,
so as to enable us to see pretty well. We found the paddles of
the canoe lying on the cross-pieces. We had nothing to take
from the boat but our tow-rope and the two small oars; these we
put into the canoe, and then getting in ourselves, we let the boat
go adrift. We put her head to the northward, between the island
and the main, and paddled away as fast as we could.</p>

<p>The captain was a much better hand than I was, and he therefore
took the office of steersman. The water was as smooth as
glass, and we made rapid progress, and did not discontinue our
exertions, except now and then resting for a few moments, till
the morning dawned, when we could hardly distinguish the island
we had left, and found ourselves about five miles from the
mainland. We had now time to examine the contents of the
canoe, and had much reason to be gratified with our acquisition.
It had three bear-skins at the bottom, several pounds of yams,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
cooked and uncooked, two calabashes full of water, bows and
arrows, three spears, a tomahawk, three fishing-lines and hooks,
and some little gourds full of black, white, and red paint; and
what we prized more than all, some flints and a large rusty nail,
with rotten wood to serve as tinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are fortunate,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;now, before we pull
in for the shore we must paint ourselves like Indians; at all
events, you must black yourself, as you have no shirt, and I
must do the same, although I do not require it so much as you
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us have something to eat and drink first,&rdquo; replied I,
&ldquo;and we will proceed to our toilet afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chaphead"><p>My adventures with the Indians, with what happened to the Portuguese
Captain, my companion.</p></div>


<p>Having eaten some venison, and drunk out of the calabash,
the captain painted me black, with here and there a line of red
and white on the face and shoulders. I performed the same duty
towards him, and we then resumed our paddles, and pushed in
a slanting direction for the shore. The tide now ran down against
us, and we could hardly stem it, and finding ourselves opposite a
beach clear of trees for a quarter of a mile, we agreed to run on
shore to look for a large stone. We soon found one which
answered our purpose, and paddling off again to three or four
hundred yards, we made the stone fast to the bow-rope of our
boat, and anchored the canoe with it. Having succeeded in this,
we got out the fishing-lines, and with a piece of raw meat as a
bait, we soon had several fish in the canoe; after which we put
on no more baits, but pretended to fish till the tide slacked, when
we lifted our anchor and recommenced our paddling to the northward.</p>

<p>At night we landed on a rock, close to the beach, having well
reconnoitred before it was dark to see if there were any canoes or
Indians to be seen on the shore; and thus we continued for five
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
days, during which we passed the mouths of one or two rivers,
and had gained, as we supposed, more than 150 miles along the
coast, but how much to the northward we could not tell, as we
followed the windings of the shore. We were twice obliged to
land to obtain water, but we always did so in the daytime, having
taken the precaution to black the whole of our bodies and take off
our trowsers before we landed. Our deer&rsquo;s flesh was all gone,
and we continued to live on fish, cooking as much as we could at
one time. The collecting firewood was the great risk which we
ran; for we were then obliged to land where there was wood. It
was on the sixth day that we were first in danger. As we rounded
a point, we fell in with another canoe with six or seven people in
it. They were not more than 300 yards off when we first saw
them. The Indians stood up in the canoe, looked at us very
earnestly, and then perceiving that we were not of their tribe, I
presume, pulled towards us. We immediately turned and pulled
away. They had been fishing, and two of them were pulling up
the lines, while the others paddled, which gave us a little advantage;
but they had three paddles and we had only two. They
shouted and paddled with all their might, but they gained little,
as they were seven in the canoe, five men and two women, and
deep in consequence. As they gained slowly upon us, notwithstanding
all our exertions, the Portuguese said to me, &ldquo;They
have no weapons in the boat, I should think; if they had, they
would use them, for we are within bow-shot. Can you use a bow
and arrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could once,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;use it very fairly,&rdquo; for when I
was captive with Whyna, she would often practise the bow and
arrow with me, and I became somewhat expert before I left her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let me paddle on, and do you put
an arrow in the bow and threaten them, at all events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did so, and stood up, taking aim as if about to shoot, at
which they ceased paddling, and after talking a little they turned
the head of their canoe round, and made for the shore. We
proceeded, as may be imagined, with all diligence. I laid down
my bow and arrows and resumed my paddle, and in an hour we
could no longer see our late pursuers. We continued our voyage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
and for three days met with no further adventures, when about
noon, on the fourth day, the sky became overcast, and there was
every prospect of rough weather. Before night the wind and sea
rose, and it was no longer possible for us to keep along the coast,
which already was covered with breakers.</p>

<p>We had, therefore, no remedy but to make for the shore and
haul up the canoe, for we could not perceive any inlet which
might shelter us. It was quite dark when we dashed the canoe
through the breakers and landed. We hauled her up some
distance, as there was every appearance of worse weather, and
sheltered ourselves under the lee of a high rock. The wind now
blew fiercely, and rain descended in torrents. We tried to light
a fire to warm ourselves, but could not succeed, so we lay down
on one bear-skin, and covered ourselves with the others,
waiting impatiently for daylight. When the day dawned, the
weather was worse than ever. We now looked out for a better
place of concealment for ourselves and our canoe, and found one
at about fifty yards&rsquo; distance: between two high rocks there was a
narrow cleft or passage, which was large enough for us and for
the canoe, and this hid us both from the storm and from the sea.
Into this cleft we hauled our canoe and withdrew ourselves,
making a meal off some fish we roasted on the embers. We
remained there for two days, when the weather moderated, but
the sea was still too rough for us to launch the canoe; so we
decided upon remaining one day more, although our provisions
were all gone and our calabashes quite empty. On the third day,
to our great surprise and alarm, we heard the report of a musket
not far from us. From this we knew that we could not be very
far from the English settlements, for it was only the Indians near
to the settlements who had obtained muskets. But whether it
was an Indian or a white man who fired we could not, of course,
tell. I recollected that, in the last advices we had had from
James Town, our factors had stated that there was a cruel war
carried on between the Indians and the settlers, and that the Indians
had ravaged the plantations; but that was two years ago, and
how it might be now it was impossible to tell. A second report
of a musket still nearer induced me to creep along by the side of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
the rock, and look out to see if any one was near. To my great
alarm, I perceived five Indians with muskets not a hundred yards
off. I drew back, as I hoped, unperceived, but the eye of an
Indian was too keen. They had discovered me; and whilst I was
relating to the Portuguese captain what I had seen, they were
suddenly upon us. We had no time to make resistance, even if
we were inclined so to do, we therefore sat still. They came up
and looked at us. The wet had washed off a great portion of the
paint upon my back and shoulders. One of the Indians touched
me on the shoulder, and said, &ldquo;Ugh!&mdash;white man paint like
Indian.&rdquo; They then examined the canoe and its contents, and
having spoken a few words to each other, apparently relating to
the canoe, they put a thong of leather round each of our arms,
and, making a motion for us to follow them, they led us away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our best, and could do no more,&rdquo; said the
Portuguese; &ldquo;I feel that it&rsquo;s all over with me now, and I shall
soon sleep in the bosom of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart was too full to make any reply. The Indians led on,
and I followed in silence.</p>

<p>We passed through the woods, which appeared to be interminable,
till the night closed in, and then the Indians halted,
and while one remained as guard over us, the others collected
wood for a fire. They had some provisions, but offered none to
us. After an hour they lay down to sleep round the fire, placing
me and the Portuguese captain next to the fire, and lying outside
of us. They were soon fast asleep, or appeared to be, when I
said to the captain, &ldquo;Have you your knife? for if they remain
asleep, let us wait an hour or so, and if you can cut the leather
thong which the Indian holds in his hand, and then watch your
opportunity, I will do the same, and we may escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my knife, but my Indian is not asleep,&rdquo; replied he;
&ldquo;I will wait till he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What signal shall we make if we succeed?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you are ready, lift your arm up, I shall understand,
and if I am ready, I will do the same. Agreed; and now let
us be quiet, for depend upon it our conversation has roused
them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
We then composed ourselves, as if to sleep, and remained
in that way for more than an hour, by which time we were convinced
that our captors were slumbering. I then drew out my
knife, for the Indians had not attempted to rifle us, and cut the
thong which was round my arm, without awaking the Indian who
had the other end in his hand. I remained quiet for a quarter of
an hour, when the Portuguese lifted up his arm as a signal that
he was free. I listened attentively, and being certain that the
Indians were asleep, I lifted up my arm also.</p>

<p>The Portuguese then rose up carefully, and without noise,
stepping past the bodies of the Indians, till he was clear of the
circle. I did the same, and pointed to the muskets, which lay
on the grass by the Indians. He took one up and I another, and
we retreated to a short distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must have the other muskets,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;stay where
you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I advanced cautiously and took up the other three muskets,
and was retreating with them, when one of the Indians turned
round as if awaking. I ran past the Portuguese, and making a
sign for him to follow me, we retreated a few yards into the wood,
where we could watch the Indians without being seen ourselves.
The Portuguese motioned to be off, but I detained him, and I
was right. The Indian roused up and sat upon his haunches;
perceiving that we had escaped, he waked up the others. They
started on their feet, and looking round, found that the muskets
were all gone; and then they held a consultation. At last they
appeared to have made up their minds to follow, and, if possible,
recapture us, for they went back in the direction of the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, we must hide three of the muskets,&rdquo; said I,
in a whisper, &ldquo;and keep the others to defend ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We examined and found that they were all loaded, and the
Portuguese then said to me, &ldquo;There are five of them. If they
meet with us, and we discharge two muskets and we do not kill,
we shall be at their mercy. If we do kill, still there will be three
against two; we had better carry all the muskets. Do you take
two, and I will take three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I thought he was right, I consented, and we now went the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
same path towards the sea which the Indians had done before us
in pursuit of us. We walked fast, as we knew the Indians would
do the same, and they had the start of us, so that we were not
likely to come up with them. It was severe work, but we did not
slacken our pace, and before dawn the sea was quite visible
through the branches of the trees, for we had arrived at the outskirts
of the wood.</p>

<p>As soon as we had gained the beach, which was 500 yards
wide, we looked round to see if we could perceive the Indians,
but we could observe nobody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us, while it is yet dark, go round so as to get on the
opposite side of the rocks where we were concealed,&rdquo; said the
Portuguese. &ldquo;If they are there, we shall take them by surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keeping just within the wood, we walked half a mile to the
southward, and then emerged just as the day was breaking, and
made for the rocks. As soon as we arrived, we examined very
cautiously before we entered the cleft, but there was nobody
there, and the canoe was safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not here,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where can they be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They cannot be far off,&rdquo; said the Portuguese; &ldquo;I suspect
they are hidden somewhere, and intend to surprise us while we
are launching our canoe, and when our muskets will be out of
our hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you; let us now wait at some little distance
from the rocks till broad daylight, we shall then be secure from
surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did so, and when the sun rose we looked well round, but
could see nobody. We entered the cleft, and were about to lay
down the muskets, and lay hold of the canoe, when I perceived
a small piece of rock to drop down. This caused me immediately
to suspect the truth, and I cried to the Portuguese to come back
with me. He did so, and I told him that I was certain that the
Indians had climbed the rock, and were lying down on the top of
it, ready to pounce upon us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, they must be there,&rdquo; said he, when I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
mentioned the falling piece of rock; &ldquo;let us walk round and see
if we can discover them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did so, but they were too well concealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what must be done now?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is useless our
attempting to clamber to the top of the rock, for no one could do
it with a musket in his hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;that is certain; and if we attempt to bring
the canoe out of the cleft, they may drop down upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that if we were to go in and take the
tow-rope in our hands, which is several yards long, we might
haul out the canoe by it, and when once it is clear of the cleft
they cannot move without our seeing them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will try, at all events,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;Do you stay on
the watch while I get hold of the tow-rope and bring it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indians did not expect this man&oelig;uvre, it was clear. Still
keeping the muskets in our possession, the butts on the sand,
and the muzzles resting on our shoulders, we laid hold of the
tow-rope, and by great exertion hauled the canoe several yards
away from between the two rocks. We then paused for breath
after a minute or two, with our eyes fixed upon the top of the rock
to see if they moved, and then we hauled it at least a hundred
yards further off, when for the first time I perceived that the bow
and arrows were not in the canoe, and that they must have been
taken by the Indians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must haul again,&rdquo; said the Portuguese, when I
stated this to him, &ldquo;till we are out of bow-shot. Let us put the
muskets into the canoe, and drag it as fast as we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did so, and gained another hundred yards before we
stopped, when an arrow was discharged from the summit of the
rock, and buried itself in the sand close to my feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haul again,&rdquo; said the Portuguese, &ldquo;we are not out of shot
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again we exerted ourselves, and gained another hundred
yards, during which two more arrows were discharged, and one
of them went through the left arm of my comrade; but as it was
through the fleshy part, and did not touch the bone, it did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
disable him. A third arrow was sent after us, but did not reach
us, and we knew that we were out of distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut the shaft of the arrow, and draw it through the arm,&rdquo;
said the Portuguese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they will perceive me doing so, and
will think that you are disabled. That may induce them to rush
upon us, thinking they have only one man to deal with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no great matter,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;we must now
drag our canoe down to the water and launch her, if they will let
us. We have outwitted them so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We now turned the head of the canoe towards the sea, and
slowly dragged her down; our eyes, as may be supposed, constantly
kept upon the rock, to see if the Indians would move, but
they did not. They perhaps felt that they had no chance with us,
having all the fire-arms and an open beach in our favour. We
launched our canoe without further interruption on their part,
and in a few minutes, taking care to be out of arrow distance, we
passed the rock with our head to the northward. When about
two miles off, we perceived the Indians to descend from the rock
and walk away into the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us praise God for this miraculous escape,&rdquo; said I to the
Portuguese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do; and the holy patron saint who has preserved me,&rdquo;
replied the Portuguese captain; &ldquo;but I am still heavy at heart.
I feel that we have escaped only to come into more strange and
fresh calamity. I shall never get back to Lisbon, that I feel convinced
of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried all I could to encourage him, but it was of no avail.
He told me that the presentiment was too strong, and could not
be overcome by any argument. Indeed he appeared to have
allowed the idea so to have taken possession of his mind, that his
reason became enervated; and having heard how the Indians
burnt their prisoners, he talked about martyrdom at the stake,
and rising up to Heaven in great glory, there to be received by the
whole body of saints and legions of angels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the use of our thus labouring at the paddle?&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;why not at once let us go ashore and receive the crown of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
martyrdom? I am ready; for I long for the hour, and shall rejoice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said all I could to keep him quiet, but it was useless, and
such was his insanity, that he gradually neared the shore by
steering against me with his paddle, so that I could not prevent
it. I had drawn the shaft of the arrow through his arm, and he
appeared to feel no pain. I expostulated with him at his keeping
the canoe so near to the shore, but he smiled and gave no reply.</p>

<p>We had the stream against us, and made but little way, and
it vexed me very much to hear him talk so loud as he did, as the
Indians must have heard him, and I thought would follow us
along the coast; but he ransacked the whole book of martyrs,
telling me how one had his body sawn in two, another was
pinched to death; this one burnt, that tortured; every variety of
death he entered upon during the whole of that day without
ceasing.</p>

<p>I ascribed much of this to the pain arising from the wounded
arm, notwithstanding which he paddled with as much vigour as
ever. As the night came on, I entreated him to hold his tongue,
but it was in vain, and I felt assured that his reason was quite
gone. He continued to talk loud and rave without intermission,
and I now considered our fate as sealed. We had no water in the
boat or provisions of any kind, and I proposed that we should
heave-to and catch some fish, telling him that if he talked we
should scare them away.</p>

<p>This made him quiet for a time, but as soon as we had hooked
four or five fish, he again commenced his history of the glorious
martyrs. I prayed him to be silent, for a short time at least,
and he was so for about four or five minutes, when he would
break out into some ejaculation, which I immediately stopped.
At last he could talk no more for want of water; his lips were
glued together, and so were mine. Nevertheless, I continued
paddling for two hours more, when I found by the canoe grounding
that he had steered her on the beach. There was no help for
it. We landed and went in search of water, which we found
about half of a mile from where our canoe was beached.</p>

<p>We drank heartily, filled the calabash, and were returning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
to the canoe, when he again commenced talking as loud as ever.
I was in great anger, but I put my hand before his mouth, beseeching
him in a whisper to be quiet. As we were doing this,
we were suddenly sprung upon and seized by several Indians,
and in a minute were bound hands and feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; cried the Portuguese; &ldquo;I knew it would be so.
Well, I am prepared; are not you, my good friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no reply. I felt that in his madness he had sacrificed
his own life and mine also; but it was the will of Heaven. The
Indians left two to guard us, and went down to the canoe, returning
with their muskets. I soon perceived that they were the
same whom we had escaped from the night before, and the one
who had spoken a little English when we were first captured now
came to me and said, &ldquo;White man paint like Indian, steal
gun&mdash;ugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Indians had returned from the canoe, our feet were
unbound, and we were again led away by the leather thong which
was fast to our arms. The Portuguese now began to find his
tongue again, and talked incessantly, the Indians not checking
him; from which, it was evident that they were on their own
domains. After four hours&rsquo; walking they kindled a fire, and
went to repose as before; but this time they took our knives from
us, and bound our legs so tight that they gave us much pain.
I did not expostulate, as I knew it was useless. My companion,
as the thong entered into his flesh, seemed pleased, saying,
&ldquo;Now my martyrdom is commencing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas! poor man; but I will not anticipate. We travelled
three days, during which we were supplied with a small portion
of parched Indian corn every day, just sufficient for our sustenance,
and no more. On the fourth morning the Indians, after
an hour&rsquo;s travelling, set up some shrill and barbarous cries,
which I afterwards discovered was their warhoop. These cries
were replied to by others at a distance, and in about a quarter of
an hour afterwards we found ourselves close to a number of
wigwams, as they are termed (the Indian houses), and soon surrounded
by a large party of men, women, and children, who
greeted us with taunts and menaces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
We were led into a larger wigwam than the others, where we
found several Indians of grave aspect assembled, and a man who
could speak English was ordered in as interpreter. He asked us
where we came from in the canoe. I replied, that we came from
the south, but we had been wrecked in a big ship, and had taken
the canoe, which we found on the beach. They asked no more
questions. We were led out, and in about an hour afterwards
the Indian who had spoken English to us when we were captured,
came up with two others and painted us black, saying, &ldquo;The
white man like paint. Black paint good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not know till afterwards that this painting black was a
sign that we were condemned to death, but so it was. They took
off our trowsers, the only garments we had on, and left us naked.
To my surprise, they did not take the diamond which was sewed
up in leather from off my neck; but as I learnt subsequently, the
Indians are much given to conjurors and charms, wearing many
round their own necks and about their persons, and they respect
the charms that their enemies wear, indeed are afraid of them,
lest they should be harmed by having them in their possession.
We remained in a wigwam during that day, with guards over us.
The following day we were led out and cast loose, and we found
all the Indians, women and children, ranged in two lines, each
holding in their hands a club or stick, or rod of some description
or another.</p>

<p>We were led to the end of the row, and looked about us in
amazement. They made signs to us which we did not understand,
and while we were remaining in doubt as to what was to be our
fate, an old woman, who had been menacing and grinning at me
for some time, and who was the most hideous animal that I ever
beheld in the shape of a woman, thrust a straw into my eye,
giving me most excruciating agony. I was so carried away by
rage and pain, that I saluted her with a kick in the stomach,
which laid her doubled up on the ground, expecting to be scalped
for so doing the next moment. On the contrary, the Indians
laughed, while some of the other women dragged her away.</p>

<p>At last the interpreter came, and from him we learnt that we
had to run the gauntlet, and that, as soon as we gained the large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
lodge where we had been examined by the old Indians on the day
previous, we were safe, and that we must run for that as fast as
we could. The Portuguese, who was still as mad as ever, was
then pushed on; he would not run, but walked, glorying in the
blows, which showered down upon him like hail; and, moreover,
he prevented me from running for some time, till I got past
him. I had been cruelly punished, and was mad with pain,
when I perceived a tall, gaunt Indian waiting for me with a heavy
club. Careless of life or consequences, I rushed past him, and
as I passed I threw out my fist with such impetus, that, hitting
him under the right ear, he fell senseless, and it appears that he
never rose again, for the blow killed him; after which I at last
gained the council-house, and was soon afterwards followed by
my companion, who was streaming with blood. We were then
led away, and tied by our necks to two stakes about twenty yards
apart, and there we remained for the night.</p>

<p>The Portuguese passed the night in singing; I passed it in
silence and prayer. I felt convinced that we were to die, and I
feared that it would be by fire or torture, for I had heard something
of the manners and customs of these Indians. I made my
peace with God as well as a poor sinner could, prayed for mercy
through Jesus Christ, sighed my adieu to Amy, and made up my
mind to die.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Indians brought firewood, and
placed it in bundles round the stakes, at a distance of about
fourteen yards from the centre. They then went to the Portuguese,
tied his hands behind him, and exchanged the rope by
which he had been fastened for a much stronger one, one end of
which they fastened to his wrists behind him, and the other to
the stake. As they left me as I was before, it was plain that the
Portuguese was to suffer first. They then set fire to the piles of
wood which were round the stake, which were too far from him
to burn him, and I could not imagine what they intended to do,
but you may conceive that I was in a state of awful suspense and
anxiety, as I was well convinced that his fate, whatever it might
be, would be my own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
During these appalling preparations, the Portuguese appeared
as if he really enjoyed the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my good friend,&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;you shall see how
I can suffer for the true faith. Even a heretic like you shall be
converted by my example, and I shall ascend to Heaven with you
in my arms. Come on, ye fiends; come on, ye heathens, and
see how a Christian can suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much as I felt for him and for myself, I could not lament that
his reason had left him, as I thought his sufferings would be
less; but his exclamations were soon drowned by a loud yell from
the Indians, who all rushed upon my unfortunate companion.</p>

<p>For a moment or two they were crowded so thick round him
that I could not perceive what they were doing, but after that they
separated, and I beheld him bleeding profusely, his ears and
nose having been cut off, and a broken iron ramrod passed
through both cheeks. And now a scene took place, at the remembrance
of which, even now, my blood curdles. Some caught
up the burning sticks and applied them to his flesh, others stuck
him full of small splints, the ends of which they lighted. The
Indian warriors shot at him with muskets loaded with powder
only, so as to burn him terribly on every part of the body. The
women took up handfuls of lighted ashes and showered them
down on him, so that the ground he trod upon was a mass of
burning embers, and he walked upon fire.</p>

<p>Red-hot irons were now brought forward, and his body seared
in all parts, his tormentors seeking out where they could give
him the most pain. At last one applied the hot iron to his eyes,
and burnt them out. Imagine my feelings at this horrid scene&mdash;imagine
the knowledge that this was to be also my fate in a short
time; but, what is more strange to tell, imagine, Madam, my
companion not only deriding his torturers, but not flinching from
the torture; on the contrary, praising God for his goodness in
thus allowing him to be a martyr for the true faith, offering his
body to their inflictions, and shouting manfully; but such was
the behaviour of my insane friend, and this behaviour appeared
to give great satisfaction to the Indians.</p>

<p>For nearly two hours did this torture continue, his body was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
black and bloody all over, and the smell of the burning flesh was
horrible; but by this time it appeared as if he was much exhausted,
and, indeed, appeared to be almost insensible to pain.
He walked round the stake as before upon the burning coals, but
appeared not to know when further torture was applied to him or
not. He now sang hymns in Portuguese in a low voice, for he
was much exhausted. Soon afterwards he staggered and fell
down with his face upon the burning embers; but even the flesh
of his face grilling, as it were, appeared to have no effect upon
him. An Indian then went up to him, and with his knife cut a
circle round his head, and tore off the whole scalp, flesh and
hair together, and when he had done this the old woman whom I
had saluted with a kick before I ran the gauntlet, and who had
his ears hanging on her neck to a string, lifted up a handful of
burning coals, and put them upon his bleeding head.</p>

<p>This seemed to rouse him. He lifted up his head, but his
features were no longer to be distinguished, as his face was burnt
to a black coal, and he said, &ldquo;Take me, ye holy saints. Angels,
receive me,&rdquo; and, to my great astonishment, he again rose on
his legs, and tottered round and round for a few minutes. At
last he sank down, with his back against the stake, and one of
the Indians cleaved his brain with his tomahawk; and thus ended
the life and the misery of my unfortunate companion&mdash;and it was
now my turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;it is but two hours of suffering, and
then I shall be beyond their malice. May God have mercy upon
my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same preparations were now made for me. I was fastened
with the stout rope, and my arms tied behind me, the wood was
fired, and one of the chiefs was haranguing the Indians. He
finished, the low yell was given, when the old woman whom I had
before mentioned ran up to me, and saying something which I
could not understand, put her hand upon me.</p>

<p>When she did this the other Indians, who were about to rush
on me, drew back with signs of disappointment on many of their
wild countenances. The chiefs then went into the council-house,
leaving me tied where I was, and the wood burning around me,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
the mass of Indians standing about as if waiting the decision of
the chiefs. After a time three Indians, one of whom was the
interpreter, came up to me, and, kicking aside the burning
poles, cast me loose.</p>

<p>I asked the interpreter what he was about to do. He replied,
&ldquo;You kill Indian here (pointing to his own ear), you kill
him dead. Squaw lose husband&mdash;want another&mdash;take you&mdash;stead
of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They led me to the council-house before the chiefs. The old
woman whom I had kicked was there. It was her husband that
I had killed by the blow behind the ear, and she had claimed me
in his stead, and, according to the custom of the country, her
claim was allowed, and I was made over to her, and received into
the tribe. Strange custom for a woman to marry the murderer of
her husband, but still such it was, and thus did I find myself
freed from the stake when I least expected it. The principal chief
made me a speech, which was interpreted, in which he told me
that I was now the husband of Manou, and was one of their own
tribe; that I must be strong in war, and must hunt and procure
venison for my family.</p>

<p>They then washed off the black paint, and after a few more
speeches and ceremonies, I was handed over to the hideous old
hag, whose neck was still decorated with the two ears of my companion.
To say that I would have preferred the torture would be
saying too much, but that I loathed the creature to excess was
certain. However, I said nothing, but allowed her to take me
by the hand and lead me to her wigwam. As soon as we were in
she brought me some venison, which I ate greedily, for I had
had nothing for thirty-six hours. She then offered me the leggings,
as they call them, which the Indians wear, and the other
portions of the Indian dress, which probably belonged to her late
husband. I put them on, as I was glad to cover my nakedness,
and, worn out with walking and exertion, I first thanked God for
my miraculous preservation, and then lay down and fell into a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>It was not until the next day that I awoke, and I then perceived
the old woman rubbing oil upon the deep cuts made in my wrists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
and shoulders by the leather thongs. She again set meat before
me, and I ate heartily, but I looked upon her with abhorrence,
and when she attempted to fondle me, I turned away and spit with
disgust, at which she retired, grumbling. I now had leisure to
reflect. I passed over with a shudder the scenes that had passed,
and again returned thanks to God for my deliverance. I called to
mind how often I had been preserved and delivered. From my
bondage in Africa, from my imprisonment in the Tower, from
my hopeless slavery in the mines, from our wreck on the island,
and now, after passing through such dangers, from an almost
certain cruel death by torture. Truly did I feel how grateful I
ought to be for that Providence which had so often preserved me,
and that my only reliance in future must be in its gracious protection.</p>

<p>But here I was, married to a woman I detested, and living
with barbarians; and I said to myself, &ldquo;That kind Heaven which
has already done so much for me will, in its own good time, also
release me from this thraldom. In the meanwhile let me not
murmur, but be thankful.&rdquo; My squaw, as they call their wives
among the Indians, now came up to me and offered to paint me,
and I thought it advisable that she should, as I felt that the sooner
I conformed myself to their customs the more chance I had
of making my escape, which I was resolved to do the first opportunity.</p>

<p>As soon as she had completed my toilet I walked out of the
wigwam, that I might look about me and be seen. The Indians,
who were sauntering about, met me with a friendly &ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo;
which appeared a favourite monosyllable with them. At last I
met with the interpreter, and began to converse with him. I
asked what nation I was now belonging to, and he said the Massowomicks.
I asked how large their country was, and he told
me much which I could not understand, except that it appeared
to me a very powerful nation.</p>

<p>I was very careful of mentioning the English, or any thing
about their settlement, although I was anxious to know where it
was; but I asked him whether they were at war with any other
nation. He said &ldquo;No, they had been at war with other tribes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
but that they had all made peace that they might join against the
white man, who had taken their land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an Indian now,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you will forget the white man,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You
have now red blood in your veins. You marry Indian wife, you
all the same as one Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;War Indian beat his wife, suppose she talk too
much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty talk, plenty beat,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose my wife talk too much and I beat her, what Indian
people say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say good. Suppose wife too old, you take two wife, one
more young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was very much pleased with this conversation; not that I had
the slightest idea of profiting by his information by taking another
wife, but I felt such a disgust at my present one, and had
already seen what a fury she could be, that I was resolved, if
necessary, to show her that I was master, for I felt certain that
if I did not, she would soon attempt to master me, and so it
turned out.</p>

<p>On the third day she took down a bow and arrows and made a
sign to me to go out, and, I presumed, bring back food; and as
there was nothing in the house, I thought the request reasonable.
I therefore went out of the wigwam and found that many of the
young men were going out on a hunting-party, and that I was to
join them. We set off and travelled for six hours before we came
to the hunting-ground, and as the deer passed me I thought of
Whyna and my hunting excursions with her. I was, however,
fortunate, and killed two deer, much to the surprise of the Indians,
who thought a white man could not use a bow and arrows,
and I rose very much in their estimation in consequence. The
deer was cut up, and we hung upon branches what we could not
carry.</p>

<p>We did not go home that night, but feasted over a large fire.
The next morning we all carried home our loads, and mine was
as large as any of the others, if not larger; neither did I flag on
the way, for I was naturally very strong and active, and had lately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
been inured to fatigue. When we arrived, the squaws and men
among the others were despatched for the remainder of the venison.
I now went out every day by myself and practised with my
bow, till I had become more expert, for I wanted practice. I
had no musket, but I had a tomahawk and a long knife. I began
to pick up a few words of the language, and by means of the interpreter
I gained them very fast. Before I had been three months
with the Indians I had acquired their confidence and respect.
They found that I was expert, and able to gain my own livelihood,
and I may add that before I had been three months I had also
mastered my wife. When she found that I would not submit to
her caresses, she was very indignant and very violent, but I immediately
knocked her down, and beat her unmercifully. This
brought her to her senses, and after that I treated her as my slave
with great rigour, and as she was a notorious scold, the Indians
liked me all the better for it.</p>

<p>You may think that this was not fair treatment towards a
woman who had saved my life; but she only saved it for her own
purposes, and would have worn my ears, as well as my companion&rsquo;s,
if I had not killed her husband. The fact is, I had no
alternative; I must have either treated her kindly and submitted
to her nauseous endearments, or have kept her at a respectful
distance by severity, and I hardly need say that I preferred the
latter. So far as her choice of a husband was concerned, she
made a bad one, for she received nothing but blows and bad
usage. I had one day driven my wife out of the wigwam in consequence
of her presuming to &ldquo;talk too much,&rdquo; as the Indian said,
when the interpreter told me that one of the chiefs was willing
that I should marry his daughter, polygamy being one of their
customs.</p>

<p>I was very much annoyed at this, for I knew the young girl
very well: she was very graceful and very pretty; and I felt that
my fidelity to Amy would be in great danger if the marriage was
to take place; and if proposed, I dared not refuse so great a distinction.</p>

<p>I replied that I was fortunate, but that I feared my present
wife would make her very unhappy, as she wanted to be the chief
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
woman of the wigwam, and when I was away I could not tell
what the old woman might do to her, and the conversation was
dropped.</p>

<p>This little Indian had, before this, shown me as much favour
as an Indian girl ever ventures to show, sufficient, at all events,
to satisfy me that I was not disagreeable to her, and what the interpreter
had said made me very uncomfortable. However, I
consoled myself with the recollection that if I were compelled to
marry this girl, it would be an involuntary infidelity on my part,
and on that account might well be excused; for the hope of again
rejoining Amy never left me at any time.</p>

<p>One day I went out in search of deer, and was led away from
my companions after a buck which I had wounded and attempted
to overtake. They saw me in chase of my quarry, and left me in
pursuit. I followed for several hours, continually coming up
with it and as continually losing it again. At last, I heard the
report of a musket close to where the deer was last seen by me,
and I thought that some Indian had shot it. I walked forward,
however, very cautiously, and perceived a white man standing
by the animal, which lay at his feet. I started back, for I did
not know whether I had fallen in with a friend or a foe; but as I
knew that he had not had time to reload his musket, I hallooed
to him, concealing myself at the same time behind a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Evans?&rdquo; said the man in reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is an Englishman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, show yourself, then,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am dressed as an Indian,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I was taken by the
Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come along,&rdquo; said the man, who was attired as a
seafaring man.</p>

<p>I came from behind the tree, and when he saw me he
snatched up his musket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I should like to see what I am afraid
of; but I&rsquo;ll be on my guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
I then told him that I had been taken by the Indians, and they
saved my life because one of their women chose me as her husband,
and that I was anxious to escape from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am on board of a schooner at anchor
down below in the river. There are a few of us come on shore to
get some venison, and I have lost my comrades; but I had no
idea that the Indians were down here so close to the English
settlements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How close are we, then?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;for I know not where I
am. This is certainly not our usual hunting-ground, for I have
been led many miles from it, in pursuit of the animal you have
just shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought so; for I have been on shore here more
than once, and I have never met with an Indian. You ask how
far you are from the settlement; that I can hardly tell you, because
the settlers have spread out so far; but you are about forty
or fifty miles from James Town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what river, then, is your schooner at anchor in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the name,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure
that it has a name. We come here for wood and water, because
it is quiet, not inhabited, and no questions asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you, then?&rdquo; inquired I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, we are what are called &lsquo;Jolly
Rovers;&rsquo; and if you have a mind to come on board, we can find a
berth for you, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but I am not sufficiently fond
of the sea, and I should be of no use&rdquo; (for, by his term of Jolly
Rover, I knew that they were pirates).</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you please,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;no harm&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;and I thank you for your kind offer, but
I cannot live long on board of a vessel. Will you now tell me
which is the right track to the English plantations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they bear right out in that direction; and
I dare say, if you travel five or six leagues, you will fall aboard
of some plantation or another&mdash;right in that quarter; follow
your nose, old fellow, and you can&rsquo;t go wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;am I likely to meet your companions?&mdash;they
may take me for an Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in that direction,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;they were astern of me
a long way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell, then, and many thanks,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old fellow; and the sooner you rub off that
paint, the sooner you&rsquo;ll look like a Christian,&rdquo; said the careless
rover, as I walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No bad advice,&rdquo; I thought: for I was now determined to
make for the English settlements as fast as I could, &ldquo;and I will
do so when I once see an English habitation, but not before; I
may fall in with Indians yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then set off as fast as I could, and being now inured to
running for a long time without stopping, I left the rover a long
way behind me in a very short time. I continued my speed till it
was dark, when I heard the barking of a dog, which I knew was
English, for the Indian dogs do not bark. I then proceeded
cautiously and in the direction where I heard the dog bark, and
arrived in a quarter of an hour to a cleared ground, with a rail
fence round it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;that I am at last among my own
countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I considered, however, that it would not be prudent to show
myself, especially in my Indian paint, at such a time of night,
and I therefore sat down under the lee-side of a large tree, and
remained there till morning. I then looked about for water, and
having found a running stream, I washed off my paint, and appeared
what I really was, a white man in an Indian dress. I
then went up again to the clearing, and looked for the habitation,
which I discovered on the top of a hill, about four hundred yards
off. The trees were cleared away for about three hundred yards
all round it. It was built of heavy logs, let into one another,
with one window only, and that very small. The door was still
shut. I walked up to it, and tapped at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; replied a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Englishman, and a stranger,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I have just
escaped from the Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see what you are in a very short time,&rdquo; replied
the voice. &ldquo;James, get me my gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute the door opened, and I beheld a woman more
than six feet high, of gaunt appearance and large dimensions: I
thought that I had never seen such a masculine creature before.
It was her voice which I had heard. Two men were seated by
the fire-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said she, with the musket ready for the
present.</p>

<p>I told her in a few words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me the palm of your hand&mdash;turn it up at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did so, without the least idea of the reason for the demand;
but I afterwards discovered that it was to ascertain whether I was
one of those who had been transported to the settlement, as they
all had the letter R branded on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not a gaol-bird, then, I see: you may come
in; but you&rsquo;ll give me that bow and arrows, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s nothing like making sure in this world; and
although you look a very peaceable, good-looking sort of personage,
notwithstanding your Indian set-out, still I&rsquo;ve known
just as amiable people as you, in appearance, very mischievous
at times. Now come in, and let us hear what you have to say for
yourself. Jeykell, get some more wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One man went out to obey her orders; the other sat by the fire
with his musket between his knees. I sat down by the fire, at the
request of the woman, who had seated herself by the side of the
man, and then, on her repeating her question, I gave her a narrative
of my adventures, from the time that I left Rio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;we seldom hear stories like them; it&rsquo;s
all the world like a book; and pray what&rsquo;s that thing (pointing to
the diamond in its case) you have hanging to your neck there?
you have left that out in your history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a charm given me by my Indian wife, to preserve me
from disasters from wild animals; no panther, wolf, or bear will
ever attack me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if so be it has that power, all I can say
is, it&rsquo;s not a bad charm to wear in these parts, for there are animals
enough in the woods in summer, and round the house all
night in winter; but I don&rsquo;t believe a bit in the charm, and that&rsquo;s
the truth; however, if it does no good, it can&rsquo;t do no harm, so
you may keep it on, and welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask how far it is to James Town?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, going to James Town already? I suppose you expect
to be there to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, my good woman,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;I must trespass
upon your kindness to give me something to eat, for I am
hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good woman! bah! and pray how dare you call me good
woman? Call me mistress, if you want any thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Well, then, mistress, will
you give me something to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. James, fetch the meal-cake and a bit of salt
pork, and give him to eat, while I call the cows from the
bush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mistress, as I shall in future call her, then put down her
musket and left the cabin. During her absence I entered into
conversation with the man called James, for the other had gone
out. To my inquiry how far it was to James Town, he replied
that he really did not know; that he was sent out a convict, and
sold for ten years to the husband of the mistress, who had died
two years ago; that this man had a small vessel, in which he
went to James Town by water, and that he had returned with him
in his vessel; that the distance by water, he considered about
one hundred and fifty miles, but by land it was not half that distance;
that he did not know the way, nor did he believe that there
was any road as yet made to James Town, as this plantation was
quite by itself, and a long way from any other. He understood
that the nearest plantation was twenty miles off, and he knew
there was no road to it, as no one ever went or came except by
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are not the settlers at war with the Indian
tribes that surround them?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes; and have been now for three or four years; and the
Indians have done great mischief to the plantations, and killed a
great many people; but the settlers have punished them severely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how is it that this plantation, which is so solitary, has
not been attacked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the mistress&rsquo;s husband was a great friend of the
Indians, and it is said used to bring them cargoes of muskets
and ammunition from James Town, contrary to all law and regulation.
But if he was friendly with them, the mistress is not;
for she has quarrelled with the principal chief, and I should not
be surprised if we were attacked some day, and all scalped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what does the mistress say to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she don&rsquo;t care; she&rsquo;d fight a hundred Indians, or white
men either. I never saw such a creature&mdash;she&rsquo;s afraid of nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the other man I saw here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s another like myself. There were three of us, but
one was drowned by falling overboard from the sloop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but my good fellow, how shall I get to James
Town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell; but my idea is that you will never get
there unless mistress chooses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, surely she won&rsquo;t detain me by force?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she?&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know her. Why, she&rsquo;d stop an
army,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that she will let you go&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know; but that&rsquo;s my opinion. She wants another
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, do you mean to say that she&rsquo;ll make me work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to say that, according to the laws of the settlement,
she has a right to detain you. Any person found roving here,
who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself, may be detained
till something is heard about him; for he may be a runaway
convict, or a runaway apprentice, which is much the same,
after all. Now, she may say that your account of yourself is not
satisfactory, and therefore she detained you; and if you won&rsquo;t
work, she won&rsquo;t give you to eat; so there you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, we will see if she is able.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Able! if you mean strong enough, why she&rsquo;d take you
up with one hand; and she is as resolute and severe as she is
strong. I had rather have to deal with three men, and that&rsquo;s
the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the truth, James?&rdquo; cried the mistress, coming
in at the door. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear the truth from your lips, it will be
something new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that I was sent here for finding a pocket-book,
mistress; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but you did not tell him where you found it&mdash;at the
bottom of a gentleman&rsquo;s coat-pocket, you know. You can only tell
the truth by halves yet, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wishing to ascertain how far the man&rsquo;s suspicions were correct,
I said to her,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have good friends in James Town: if I were once there I
could procure money and any thing else to any amount that I required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you may have; but I&rsquo;m afraid that the
post don&rsquo;t go out to-day. One would think, after all your wanderings
and difficulties, that you&rsquo;d be glad to be quiet a little,
and remain here; so we&rsquo;ll talk about James Town some time
about next spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, mistress, I hope you will not detain me here. I
can pay you handsomely, on my arrival at James Town, for your
kind treatment and any trouble you may take for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay me! what do I want with money?&mdash;there&rsquo;s no shops
here with ribbons, and calicoes, and muslins; and if there
were, I&rsquo;m not a fine madam. Money! why I&rsquo;ve no child to
leave what I have to&mdash;no husband to spend it for me. I have
bags and bags of dollars, young man, which my husband
heaped up, and they are of as much use to me as they are
now to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you are so rich, mistress, and more glad
that your money is so little cared for and so little wanted; but if
you do not want money, I do very much want to get back to my
friends, who think I am dead, and mourn for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, if they have mourned, their sorrow is over by this
time, and therefore your staying here will not distress them
more. I may as well tell you at once that you shall not go; so
make up your mind to be contented, and you&rsquo;ll fare none the
worse for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said in so decided a tone, that, bearing in mind
what I had heard from the convict servant, I thought it advisable
to push the question no further for the present, making up my
mind that I would wait a short time, and then make my escape,
if she still persisted in detaining me by force; but this I could
not venture upon until I was in possession of fire-arms, and I
could not obtain them while she had any suspicion. I therefore
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, since you are determined I shall not go, I have nothing
more to say, except that I will wait your pleasure, and, in
the mean time, let me make myself as useful as I can, for I
don&rsquo;t want to eat the bread of idleness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very sensible young man,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;and
now you shall have a shirt to put on, which will improve your appearance
a great deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then went into the inner room, which I presumed was
her bed-room, as there were but two rooms in the cabin. As she
went out, I could not help wondering at her. On examination, I
felt assured that she was more than six feet high, and her
shoulders as broad and her arms as nervous as a man&rsquo;s of
that stature. Her chest was very expanded, but bosom she
had none. In fact, she was a man in woman&rsquo;s clothing, and I
began to doubt her sex. Her features were not bad, had they
been of smaller dimensions, but her nose was too large, although
it was straight; her eyes were grand, but they were surmounted
with such coarse eyebrows; her mouth was well shaped, and her
teeth were good and regular, but it was the mouth of an ogress;
her walk was commanding and firm; every action denoted energy
and muscle; and certainly, from the conversation I have already
made known, her mind was quite as masculine as her body&mdash;she
was a splendid monster. In a minute she returned, bringing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
me a good check shirt and a pair of duck trowsers, which I thankfully
accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty more for those who please me,&rdquo; said she, carelessly;
&ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve put them on, come out to me, and I&rsquo;ll
show you the plantation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute or two I joined her, and she led me round the tobacco-fields,
then to the maize or Indian corn grounds, pointing
out and explaining every thing. She also showed me the cows,
store pigs, and poultry. Wishing to please her, I asked many
questions, and pretended to take an interest in all I saw. This
pleased her much, and once or twice she smiled&mdash;but such a
smile! After an hour&rsquo;s ramble we returned, and found the two
servants very busy, one husking maize, and the other in the
shed where the tobacco was dried. I asked some questions of
her about the tobacco&mdash;how many casks or bales she made a
year? She replied that she made it in bales, and sold it by
weight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be heavy carriage from here to James Town?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, if it went that way it never would arrive, I
imagine,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;but I have a sloop in the river below,
which carries it round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is the time it is harvested and fit to be carried
round?&rdquo; inquired I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is now turning fast,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;all that you see hanging
in the drying-sheds has been already drawn; in three or four
weeks it will all be housed, and then we begin to pack: in about
two months from this the sloop will take it round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it not very expensive keeping a sloop on purpose,
with men to have her in charge?&rdquo; inquired I, to hear what she
would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sloop lies at anchor, without a soul on board,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;No one ever comes up this river. I believe Captain Smith,
who made the settlement, did do so once. There is another river,
about twenty miles farther down, which is occasionally frequented
by buccaneers, I am told&mdash;indeed, I know it, for my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
husband had more to do with them than perhaps was good for his
soul, but this little river is never visited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then your servants take her round?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I leave one in charge, and take two with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have but two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till you came&mdash;one died; but now I have three,&rdquo; and
she smiled at me again.</p>

<p>If I had not been so afraid of affronting her, I certainly would
have said to her, &ldquo;Do any thing, I beg, but smile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said no more on that point. She called Jeykell, who was in
the tobacco-shed, and desired him to kill a couple of chickens,
and bring them in. We then entered the cabin, and she observed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt but you are tired with so much fatigue; you
look so; go and sleep on one of their beds; you shall have one
for yourself by night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not sorry to do as she proposed, for I was tired out.
I lay down, and did not wake till she called me and told me that
dinner was ready. I was quite ready for that also, and I sat down
with her, but the two convict servants did not. She ate in proportion
to her size, and that is saying enough. After dinner she
left me, and went with her two men on her farming avocations,
and I was for a long while cogitating on what had passed. I perceived
that I was completely in her power, and that it was only by
obtaining her good-will that I had any chance of getting away,
and I made up my mind to act accordingly. I found a comfortable
bed, of the husks of Indian corn, prepared for me at night, in
an ante-room where the two servant-men slept. It was a luxury
that I had not enjoyed for a long while. For several days I remained
very quiet, and apparently very contented. My mistress
gave me no hard work, chiefly sending me on messages or taking
me out with her. She made the distinction between me and the
convicts that I always took my meals with her and they did not.
In short, I was treated as a friend and visitor more than any thing
else, and had I not been so anxious about going to England,
I certainly had no reason to complain except of my detention, and
this, it was evident, it was not in her power to prevent, as, until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
the sloop went away with the tobacco, she had no means of sending
me away. One day, however, as I was walking past the
tobacco-shed, I heard my name mentioned by the two convicts,
and stopping, I heard James say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s after, Jeykell; and he
is to be our master, whether he likes it or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;she does
make pure love to him, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true; every thing&rsquo;s fierce with her&mdash;even love&mdash;and
so he&rsquo;ll find it if he don&rsquo;t fancy her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed:&mdash;well, I&rsquo;d rather serve another ten years
than she should fall in love with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I had my choice, whether to be her husband or to
swing, I should take the cord in preference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I pity him from my heart; for he is a good youth,
and a fair-spoken and a handsome, too; and I&rsquo;m sure that he
has no idea of his unfortunate situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No idea, indeed,&rdquo; said I to myself, as I walked away.
&ldquo;Merciful Heaven! is it possible!&rdquo; And when I thought over her
conduct, and what had passed between us, I perceived not only
that the convicts were right in their supposition, but that I had,
by wishing to make myself agreeable to her, even assisted in
bringing affairs to this crisis.</p>

<p>That very day she had said to me: &ldquo;I was very young when I
married, only fourteen, and I lived with my husband nine years.
He is dead more than a year now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she said that, which she did at dinner, while she was
clawing the flesh off the bone of a wild turkey, there was something
so ridiculous in that feminine confession, coming from
such a masculine mouth, that I felt very much inclined to laugh,
but I replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a young widow, and ought to think of another husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, when she said, &ldquo;If ever I marry again, it shall not
be a man who has been burnt on the hand. No, no, my husband
shall be able to open both hands and show them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
I replied, &ldquo;You are right there. I would never disgrace myself
by marrying a convict.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I thought of these and many other conversations which
had passed between us, I had no doubt, in my own mind, but
that the convicts were correct in their suppositions, and I was
disgusted at my own blindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; said I to myself, after a long cogitation, &ldquo;if
she wants to marry me, she must go to James Town for a parson,
and if I once get there, I will contrive, as soon as extra constables
are sworn in, to break off the match.&rdquo; But, seriously,
I was in an awkward plight. There was something in that woman
that was awful, and I could imagine her revenge to be most
deadly. I thought the old Indian squaw to be bad enough, but
this new mistress was a thousand times worse. What a hard fate,
I thought, was mine, that I should be thus forced to marry
against my will, and be separated from her whom I adored. I
was a long while turning over the matter in my mind, and at last
I resolved that I would make no alteration in my behaviour, but
behave to her as before, and that if the affair was precipitated by
my mistress, that I would be off to the woods, and take my
chance of wild beasts and wild Indians, rather than consent to
her wishes. I then went into the cabin, where I found her alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexander,&rdquo; said she (she would know my Christian name,
and called me by it), &ldquo;they say widows court the men, and that
they are privileged to do so&rdquo; (I turned pale, for I little thought
that there was to be an explanation so soon); &ldquo;at all events,
whether they are or not, I know that a woman in my position
cannot well expect a young man in yours to venture without encouragement.
Now, Alexander, I have long perceived your
feelings and your wishes, and I have only to say that mine are
such as yours&rdquo; (oh, I wish they were, thought I), &ldquo;and therefore
you have but to ask and to have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was mute with fear and despair, and could not find a reply
to make to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you not answer, Alexander? Do you think me too
forward?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; stammered I; &ldquo;you are very kind, but this is so
unexpected&mdash;so unlooked for&mdash;so unhoped for&mdash;I am so
overcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Observe, Madam, how strangely the sexes were changed. I
was the woman in this instance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to consult my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consult your fiddlesticks,&rdquo; replied she, quickly. &ldquo;Who
have you got to consult? I hope, Alexander,&rdquo; said she, setting
her broad teeth together, &ldquo;that you are not trifling with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I never should think of trifling with you, mistress,&rdquo;
replied I. &ldquo;I feel much obliged to you for showing such a preference
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Alexander, that you ought; so now then, if you
please, give me your answer,&rdquo; replied she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had I been prepared for your kindness, I would have done
so at once, but I have many serious questions to put to myself,
and if you please, we will renew the subject to-morrow morning.
I will then tell you candidly how I am situated; and if after that
you do not withdraw your proposal, I shall be most happy to be
yours as soon as we can go to James Town to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;you mean to insinuate, Alexander, that
you have a wife in England, that is of no consequence in this
settlement; for those who live here are free from all English
marriages; and as for going to James Town, that is quite unnecessary.
If the people in the settlement were to wait for a parson
when they married, they would never be married at all. All
that is necessary is, that we shall draw up an agreement of marriage,
on paper, sign it, and have it witnessed. However, as I
perceive that you are flurried, I will wait till to-morrow morning
for your decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mistress then rose from her stool, and went into her
chamber, shutting to the door with more emphasis than was at
all agreeable to my nerves. I walked out into the open air to recover
myself, and to reflect upon what course I should take in
this awkward and dangerous dilemma. Marrying was out of the
question&mdash;but how to avoid it? It was almost like being stopped
by a highwayman. He says, &ldquo;Your money or your life.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
My mistress&rsquo;s demand was, &ldquo;Marriage or your life.&rdquo; There was
but one hope, which was to escape that very night, and take my
chance in the woods, and so I resolved to do.</p>

<p>I did not go in till dark; my mistress was in her own room;
the two convicts were sitting by the fire. I took my seat by them,
but did not speak, except in a whisper, telling them that their
mistress was not well, and that we had better go to bed, and not
talk. They stared at me at the idea of the mistress being ill;
they had never known her to complain of any thing since they resided
with her; but the hint was sufficient. They went to bed,
and so did I with my clothes on, watching the crevices of the
door of her room to see if her lamp was out. In about half an
hour the little thin beams through the chinks of her door disappeared,
and then I knew that she had gone to bed. I watched
two hours more before I ventured to stir. The convicts were both
snoring loud, and effectually drowned any slight noise I might
make in moving about. I went to the locker, secured all the cold
meat for provision, took down one of the muskets and ammunition-belts,
and having put the latter over my shoulders, I then
took the musket in my hand and crept softly to the door of the
cabin. Here was the only difficulty; once out, but five yards
off, and I was clear. I removed the heavy wooden bar, without
noise, and had now only to draw the bolt. I put my finger to it,
and was sliding it gently and successfully back, when my throat
was seized, and I was hurled back on the floor of the cabin. I
was so stunned by the violence of the fall, that for a short time I
was insensible. When I recovered, I felt a great weight upon
my chest, and opening my eyes, found my mistress sitting upon
me, and giving orders to the convicts, one of whom had already
lighted the lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, get off my chest,&rdquo; said I, in a faint
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will, but not yet,&rdquo; replied my mistress. &ldquo;Now,
James, hand them to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>James handed some chains to his mistress, who, turning
round as she sat on my body, made the manacle at the end of the
chain fast round my ankle. This went with a snap-spring, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
could not be opened without a key belonging to it. At last she
rose off my body, and I could breathe free. She then called to
the convicts, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go both of you into the tobacco-shed, and wait there till I
call you out. If I find you one foot nearer to us, I&rsquo;ll flay you
alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants ran off as fast at they could. When they were
gone, my mistress said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you were about to escape, were you? You would avoid
the chances of matrimony, and now you have other chances which
you little dreamt of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was the wisest thing that I could do,&rdquo; replied I.
&ldquo;Since I must be plain, I am sacredly betrothed to another
person, and I could not even for you break my faith. I meant to
have told you so to-morrow morning, but I was afraid it would
annoy you, and therefore I wished to go away without giving you
any answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir, I offered to be your wife, which would have
made you my lord and master. You refuse it, and now I make
you my slave. I give you your option; you shall either consent
to be my husband, or you shall remain as you are, and toil hard;
but any time that you think better of it, and are willing to embrace
my offer, you will be free, and I will be as a wife in subjection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but suppose I was to make you
angry after I married you, you would do to me as you have done
now. I may, perhaps, one day get free from this chain, but,
once married to you, I am a slave for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may think otherwise before long,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;in the
mean time, you may walk out and cool yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then returned to her room, and I rose, having determined
to walk out and cool myself, as she proposed; but when I was on
my legs, I found that to the other end of the chain, which was
very heavy, and about two yards long, was, riveted an iron ball
of about thirty pounds weight, so that I could not walk without
carrying this heavy weight in my hands, for it could not be
dragged. I lifted up the iron ball, and went out of the house. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
was no longer afraid of her. I was in too great a rage to fear any
thing. As I calmed, I considered my case, and found it to be
hopeless; as I thought of Amy, and the many months of hope
deferred, I wept bitterly; and I had no consolation, for the reader
may recollect that I lost my Bible when I was sent on shore,
naked almost, by the rascally captain of the Transcendant.</p>

<p>I had now been twenty months away from Liverpool, and I
felt as if my chance of seeing her that I loved was indeed hopeless.
I might remain chained in such a solitude for years, or I might
expire under her barbarous treatment, for I fully knew what I had
to expect. However, I was resolved. I prayed fervently for
support and succour in my time of trouble, and became more
composed. I remained out the whole of the night, and watched
the rising sun. The two convicts came out to their work, and
shrugged their shoulders as they passed me, but they dared not
speak to me.</p>

<p>My mistress at last came out. She commenced with abuse,
but I gave no answer. She tried soothing, but I was mute. At
last she became frantic in her passion, hurled me away from her,
and after being dreadfully beaten, I fell to the ground. She put
her foot upon my neck, and she stood there, looking like a fury.
She loaded me with epithets, and then of a sudden went down on
her knees by me, and begged my pardon, calling me her dear
Alexander&mdash;her life&mdash;entreating me to accede to her wishes.
Never was there such a tigress in love before, I really believe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;as long as I am chained, I never
will give any answer upon the present subject, that I swear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose from my side, and walked away.</p>

<p>It is impossible, my dear Madam, for me to describe what I
suffered from this woman for more than six weeks, during which
she kept me chained in this way&mdash;at one time entreating me, the
next moment kicking me, and throwing me down. I had no
peace&mdash;my life became a burden to me, and I often entreated
her, in mercy, to put an end to my sufferings. I also had my
paroxysms of rage, and would then spurn her, spit at her, and
do every thing I could, and say all that I could imagine, to show
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
my hatred and contempt. At other times I was sullen, and that
always annoyed her. She would bear my reproaches patiently&mdash;bear
any thing, so long as I would talk; but if I remained
obstinately silent, then, in a short time, her fury would break
forth. I pitied her, notwithstanding her ill-treatment, for the
woman did love me (after her own fashion) most intensely.</p>

<p>It was on the seventh week of my confinement on the chain,
that one morning very early, as I was lying in the tobacco-shed,
for she had turned me out of the cabin, I perceived among the
trees, which were about three hundred yards from the cabin,
two Indians, in what is called their war-paint, which is a sign
that they were on a hostile excursion. I remained perfectly quiet,
and well concealed, that I might watch them. The convicts had
more than once told me that the Indians would attack us, in consequence
of an insult which my mistress had offered to their
chief, with whom her husband had been so friendly; and when
they stated what had passed, I agreed with them that they would
not fail to resent the insult as soon as they could. I had therefore
always been on the look-out, but had never seen any Indians
before. My mistress, to whom I had, in our days of sweet
converse, spoken about them, always laughed at the idea of their
attacking her, and said that they might come if they liked. She
had made every preparation for them, as she had loop-holes
stuffed up with moss just below the roof of the cabin, from which
you could fire down upon them till they were within four yards of
the cabin, and other loop-holes, from which you might shoot
them when close to; the window and door were impregnable, and
provided that we were once in the cabin, there was no doubt but
that a serious, if not effectual, resistance might be made. That
the Indians were reconnoitring the cabin was evident, and that
they did not do so for nothing was equally certain. After a while,
during which I made out six of them, they fell back in the wood,
and disappeared. The dog at that moment came out to me, and
it was probably the sight of the dog which made them retreat, as
they feared that he would have given notice of their being so close
to us. I waited till the convicts came out, and then I went into
the cabin, and said,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
&ldquo;You drove me out of the house last night, and I come to
return good for evil. As I lay in the tobacco-shed, I saw six
Indians in the wood, to the east of the cabin, reconnoitring, and
I have no doubt but that you will be attacked this night, so I give
you notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you hope that, by this fear of their attack, you will be
set free, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is perfectly indifferent to me whether I am or not. I have
often asked you to put an end to my misery, and as you have not
done it, I shall bless those Indians for the friendly act; a blow
of a tomahawk will release me, if you will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let them come with their tomahawks,&rdquo; replied
she, &ldquo;and I will protect you from them, for no one shall release
you but myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I have done my duty in telling
you what I have seen, and you may take precautions or not; for
myself I care nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, I lifted up my ball of iron and went away out of
the door. I remained out of doors the whole of the day, and
therefore did not know whether my mistress took any precautions
or not, but I told the two convicts what I had seen, and advised
them not to go far from the cabin, as they would run great
danger.</p>

<p>They inquired of me where I had seen the Indians, and I
pointed out the spot in the wood, after which they went away. I
was certain that the attack would be on this night, as there was
no moon till three hours before daybreak; and as it was very
dark, it would probably take place in the early part of the night.
I had made up my mind what I would do, which was not in any
way to defend the cabin while chained, but, when I was freed,
I would fight to the last, so that I might be killed where I stood,
and not be taken alive and tortured.</p>

<p>I did not go out from home all that day, and, to my surprise,
I was not molested by my mistress. At dark she called the convicts,
but they did not answer; she came out to look for them,
and asked me whether I had seen them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
I told her that I had not seen them for two hours, and I had
thought that they were in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell them about the Indians?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and stated my opinion that they
would attack us this night, and I advised them not to go far from
the cabin, or they might be cut off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the cowardly sneaks have run off to the woods, and
left us to defend ourselves how we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not defend myself,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;I shall stay here
where I am. I wait for death, and will not avoid it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the house,&rdquo; said she, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not,&rdquo; said she, and catching up the chain and
ball in one hand, with her other arm she caught me round the
waist, and carried me into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;it is only deferring it a little longer;
they will force their way in it at last, and I will die here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until they arrive,&rdquo; replied my mistress. &ldquo;But do you
mean to say that you will not help to defend the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, as long as I am chained as a slave,&rdquo; replied
I.</p>

<p>My mistress made no reply, but busied herself with barring
the door and window. She then placed the table and stools so
that she might stand upon them and fire out of the upper loop-holes;
pulled the moss out of the loop-holes; took down the
muskets&mdash;of which there were six&mdash;from their rests, examined
the priming of those which were loaded, and loaded those which
were not. She then got out a supply of powder and ball, which
she put ready on the table, brought the axes out, that they might
be at hand, examined the water-jars to ascertain whether the
convicts had filled them as she had ordered, and then, when all
was prepared for defence, she removed the lamp into the inner
room, leaving the one we were in so dark, that the Indians could
not, by looking through the chinks or loop-holes, discover
where the occupants of the cabin might be. All these arrangements
she made with the greatest coolness, and I could not help
admiring her courage and self-possession.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
&ldquo;Is there any more to be done, Alexander?&rdquo; said she, in a
mild voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the dog?&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tied up in the tobacco-shed,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is no more to be done,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;the dog
will give you notice of their coming, as they will first occupy the
tobacco-shed as an advanced post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexander, will you promise not to escape if I set you
free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;You set me free for your own
purposes, because you wish me to help to defend your property;
and then, forsooth, when the Indians are beat off, you will chain
me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; that was not my feeling, as I sit here alive,&rdquo; replied she;
&ldquo;but I was thinking that, if forced to retreat from the
cabin, you would never be able to escape, and I never could save
you; but they should hack me to pieces first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me one question,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;In a time of peril like
this, would you, as a conscientious person, think that you were
justified in retaining in such fetters even a convict who had
robbed you? And if you feel that you would not, on what
grounds do you act in this way to a man whom you profess to
love?&mdash;I leave it to your conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remained silent for some time: when the dog barked, and
she started up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I am mad, or a fool,&rdquo; said she, sweeping back
her hair from her forehead.</p>

<p>She then took the key of the manacle out of her dress, and
released me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexander&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said I, putting my hand to her mouth, &ldquo;this is
no time to be heard speaking. Silence!&rdquo; repeated I, in a
whisper, &ldquo;I hear them, they are round the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stood upon one of the stools and looked through a loop-hole.
It was very dark, but as the Indians stood on the hill, there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
clear sky behind them as low down as their waists, and I could
perceive their motions, as they appeared to be receiving orders
from their chief; and they advanced to the door of the cabin with
axes and tomahawks. My mistress had mounted on the table at
the same time that I had got on the stool. We now got down
again without speaking, and each taking a musket, we kneeled
down at the lower loop-holes which I have described. On second
thoughts, I mounted the stool, whispering to her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
fire till I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indians came to the door and tapped, one asking in
English to be let in. No reply was given, and they commenced
their attack upon the door with their axes. As soon as this aggression
took place, I took good aim at their chief, as I presumed
him to be, who was now standing alone on the hill. I fired. He
fell immediately.</p>

<p>As I leaped from the stool my mistress discharged her
musket, and we both caught up others and returned to the loop-holes
below. By this time the blows of the axes were incessant,
and made the cabin-door tremble, and the dust to fly down in
showers from the roof; but the door was of double oak with iron
braces, and not easily to be cut through; and the bars which held
it were of great size and strength.</p>

<p>It was some time before we could get another shot at an Indian,
but at last I succeeded, and as his comrades were taking
the body away my mistress shot another. After this the blows
of the axes ceased, and they evidently had retreated. I then
went into the inner room and extinguished the lamp, that they
might not be able to see us&mdash;for the lamp gave a faint light.
We returned to the table, and loaded the muskets in the
dark.</p>

<p>As I put my musket on the table, my mistress said, &ldquo;Will
they come again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I think they will; but if you wish to talk,
we had better retreat to the fire-place: there we shall be safe
from any shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We retreated to the fire-place, and sat down on the ashes; it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
just held us both, and my mistress took this opportunity of embracing
me, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Alexander, if I had a thousand lives, I would sacrifice
them for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have but one,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and that one I will devote
for your defence; I can do no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did you fire at?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief, as I believe, who was on the hill giving orders.
He fell; and I think that he fell dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then depend upon it they will retreat,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not; they will be revenged, if they possibly can;
and we must expect a hard fight for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what can they do? They never can break through the
door, and when daylight comes we can shoot them by dozens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they will try to burn us out.
The wind is high, which is all in their favour, and I suspect
they are now gone to collect firewood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if they do fire the cabin, what shall we do? I never
thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must remain in it as long as we can, and then sally out
and fight to the last; but every thing depends on circumstances.
Be guided by me, and I will save you if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be guided by you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Recollect I am not in chains now, and that although
you have all the courage of a man, still you have not been so
accustomed to warfare as I have been. I have long been accustomed
to command, to plan, and to execute, in times of peril
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have great strength and courage; I little thought what
a lion I had chained up,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;Well, I love you all
the better for it, and I will be guided by you, for I perceive already
that you have the best head of the two. Hark! What is
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I said,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;they are laying firewood
against the logs of the cabin on the windward side&mdash;(this was on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
the side opposite to the door). Now we must try if we cannot
pick off some more of them,&rdquo; said I, rising and taking a musket.
&ldquo;Bring the stools over to this side, for we must fire from the
upper loop-holes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We remained at our posts for some time without seeing an
Indian. They had gone back to the wood for more combustibles.
At last we perceived them coming back with the wood. I should
imagine there were at least twenty of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, take good aim,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>We both fired almost at the same moment, and three Indians
fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get down, and give me another musket,&rdquo; said I to my
mistress.</p>

<p>She handed me one, and, taking another for herself, resumed
her station. We fired several times; sometimes with and
sometimes without success; for the Indians went away twice for
firewood before they had collected what they considered sufficient.
By this time it was piled up to the eaves of the cabin, and our
loop-holes were shut up; we therefore went over to the other
side, where the door was, to see if there were any Indians there,
but could not see one. We had been on the look-out for about
five minutes, when the crackling of the wood, and the smoke
forcing itself through the crevices between the logs, told us that
the fire had been applied, and the wind soon fanned it up so that
the flame poured through every chink and loop-hole, and lighted
up the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must retreat to the fire-place,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Come quickly,
or we shall be shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said she, as she did as I requested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will peep through the loop-holes on the side of the
cabin where the door is and see us plainly, until the cabin is
filled with smoke, which it soon will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me what we are to do now, for I feel if this smoke
increases we shall not be able to speak to one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This she said about five minutes after we had remained
standing in the fire-place, with our heads up the chimney.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps it will be as well,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;that I do speak so.
This fierce wind drives the smoke to leeward in volumes, but the
great burst of smoke will be when the roof is well on fire. It is
now burning fiercely on the windward side, but we must wait till
the lee-side has caught, and then the volume of smoke will be
greater. The great point is to hit the precise time of opening the
door, and escaping shrouded in a volume of smoke. If too soon,
they will perceive us, and we shall be shot down; if too late, the
roof will fall upon us, and we shall be smothered or burnt. We
had better now, I think, leave this, and be all ready. Our best
weapon, if we have to fight our way, will be an axe. Let us each
take one, and, by now going near to the door, and putting our
mouths to one of the loop-holes, we shall breathe freer, and
unbar the door at the right time. Do you agree with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you are a <em>man</em>, and I am a
<em>woman</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We left the fire-place, and having felt for and found the axes,
we went near the door, and put our mouths to the loop-holes below;
and the smoke passing above them enabled us to breathe
freer. I looked out and perceived that, with the exception of
about six yards to leeward of the cabin, there was a dense volume
of smoke rolling along the ground for a long distance, and that if
we could only once gain it without being perceived, we should
probably be saved. I therefore unbarred the door, drew the
bolt, and held it in my hand, all ready for a start. The cabin was
now in flames in every part as well as the roof. I touched my
mistress, and then took her hand in mine, watching at the loop-hole.
At last, when the heat was almost unbearable, an eddy
of the wind drove back the smoke close to the lee-side of the
cabin, and all was dark. I jumped up, opened the door, and
dragged my mistress after me; we walked out into the black
mass completely hid from our enemies, and then running hand-in-hand
as fast as we could to leeward in the centre of the smoke,
we found ourselves at least one hundred yards from the cabin
without the Indians having any idea that we were not still inside.
As we retreated, the density of the smoke became less, and I
then told her to run for her life, as the Indians would discover
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
that the door of the cabin was open and that we had escaped&mdash;and
so it proved. We were still a hundred yards from the wood
when a yell was given which proved that they had discovered our
escape, and were in pursuit. We gained the wood; I turned
round a moment to look behind me, and perceived at least forty
or fifty Indians in full pursuit of us&mdash;the foremost about two
hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we must run for it, mistress,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and we must
no longer take hands. We shall have to thread the wood. Away!
We have no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, I snatched my hand from her and sprang forward;
she following me as fast as she could, more fearful, evidently,
of my making my escape from her than of her own escape from
the Indians. As soon as I was a hundred yards in the wood, I
turned short to the right, and fled with all my speed in that direction,
because I hoped by this means to deceive the Indians, and
it was easier to run where the wood was not so thick. My mistress
followed me close: she would have hallooed to me, but she had
not breath after the first half-mile. I found out that I was more
fleet than she was. Whether encumbered with her clothes, or
perhaps not so much used to exercise, I heard her panting after
me. I could easily have left her, but my fear was that she would
have called to me, and if she had, the Indians would have heard
her, and have known the direction I had taken, and, when once
on my trail, they would, as soon as daylight came, have followed
me by it to any distance; I therefore slackened my speed so as
just to enable my mistress to keep up with me at about ten yards&rsquo;
distance; when we had run about three miles I felt certain that
she could not proceed much further: speak she could not, and
as I ran without once looking behind me, she could make no
sign. I continued at a less rapid pace for about a mile further.
I did this to enable her to keep up with me, and to recover my
own breath as much as possible previous to a start. The voices
of the Indians had long been out of hearing, and it was clear that
they had not discovered the direction which we had taken. I knew,
therefore, that they could not hear her now, if she did cry out as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
loud as she could, and I gradually increased my speed, till I
could no longer hear her panting behind me; I then went off at
my full speed, and after a few minutes I heard her voice at some
distance faintly calling out my name. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;but
I have not forgotten the ball and chain; and if you thought that
you had let loose a lion while we were in the cabin, you shall find
that you have loosed a deer in the woods.&rdquo; I then stopped for a
few moments to recover my breath; I did not, however, wait
long; I was afraid that my mistress might recover her breath as
well as myself, and I again set off as fast as I could. The idea
of torture from the Indians, or again being kept confined by my
mistress, gave me endurance which I thought myself incapable
of. Before morning I calculated that I had run at least twenty
miles, if not more.</p>

<p>With the perspiration running down me in streams, and
hardly able to drag one leg before the other, I at last, just about
daybreak, gave it up, when I threw myself on the ground, and
dropped out of my hand my axe, which I had carried the whole
way. I lay there for more than half an hour, tormented with
thirst, but quite unable to move. At last I recovered; and, as
I well knew that the Indians would divide in parties of three or
four, and hunt every part of the woods, and by daylight probably
discover my track, I rose and prepared to resume my toil, when,
looking round me, I perceived that I was exactly on the spot where
I had followed the deer, and had fallen in with the Jolly Rover,
as he termed himself, who had pointed out the way to the plantations.
I turned and saw the river below, and as he had told me
that the Indians never came there, I resolved to go to the river,
where, at least, I should find shell-fish and water. I did so;
and in half an hour arrived at the skirts of the wood, and found
that the river was about four hundred yards from me and clear of
trees at the mouth for some distance. I went down to the river,
which ran swiftly out, and I drank till I was ready to burst. I
then rose on my feet, and walked along its banks towards the
mouth, thinking what I should do. To get to James Town appeared
to me to be an impossibility, unless by water, and I was
not likely to meet with any other vessel here but a pirate. Should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
I then go aboard of a pirate? It appeared to me to be my only
resource, and that I should be happy if I could find one.</p>

<p>By this time I had arrived at the mouth of the river, and, looking
out to seaward, I saw a schooner at anchor. She was about
three miles off. That she was a pirate vessel, I presumed.
Should I go on board of her or not? and if so, how was I to get
on board? All her boats were up: and I surmised that she had
just left the river with the intention of sailing as soon as there was
any wind, for now it was calm. The river ran out swiftly, and I
thought I should be able to swim the distance with the assistance
I should obtain from the current, which swept down right for her,
and she was riding to its strength.</p>

<p>I was demurring. I had been perhaps two hours on the beach,
waiting to see if she might send a boat on shore, when, as I stood
at the river-side, still hesitating, I happened to turn round and
perceived three Indians coming down upon me as fast as they
could. I hesitated no longer, but plunged into the stream, and
was swept out two hundred yards before they arrived at the beach.
I made for the schooner; and the current ran out so fast, that in
half an hour I was close to her. I swam for her cable, which I
clung to, and then shouted loudly. This induced some of the
crew to look over the bows, and they handed me a bowling knot,
into which I fixed myself, and was hauled on board.</p>

<p>I was dragged aft to give an account of myself, and I stated in
few words that I had been pursued by the Indians, and swam off
to save my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we met before?&rdquo; said a rough voice.</p>

<p>I looked, and saw the Jolly Rover, whom I had fallen in with
on shore. I said, &ldquo;Yes; I was escaping from the Indians
when I met you, and you showed me the direction of the plantations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a true bill; and were those
Indians after you that we saw on the beach just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied; and then I stated how it was that they had
attacked our cabin, and how we had escaped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was well done, and so you swam off three miles. Fire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
and water won&rsquo;t hurt you; that&rsquo;s clear. You&rsquo;re just the man for
us. What thing-um-bob is this that you have hung round your
neck?&rdquo; said he, taking up the leathern bag with the diamond
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied I&mdash;a sudden thought having struck me&mdash;&ldquo;is
my caul; I was born with a caul, and I have always worn it,
as it saves a man from drowning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder that you swam three miles, then,&rdquo; replied the
man.</p>

<p>You must know, Madam, that some people are born with a
membrane over the face, which is termed a caul, and there has
been a vulgar error that such people can never be drowned, especially
if they wear this caul about their person in after-life. Sailors
are superstitious in many things, but particularly in this,
and my caul was therefore as much respected by them as it hung
round my neck, as it was by the Indians when they thought it was
what they call &ldquo;magic&rdquo; or &ldquo;medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Jolly Rover, &ldquo;as you had so much fire,
so much water, and so much running, I think you won&rsquo;t be sorry
to have a biscuit and glass of grog, and then turn in; to-morrow
we will talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went down below, very glad to accept the offer, and as I
was regaling myself, who should come up to me but two of the
Portuguese who had been wrecked in the xebeque, and put on
shore with me in the little boat by the captain of the Transcendant.
I was very glad to see them. They told me that, after
great hardship and suffering, they had arrived famished at the
banks of this river, and had been taken on board by the pirates,
and had remained with them ever since; that they were very
anxious to get away, but never had an opportunity. I begged
them not to say who I was, but merely that I was once a shipmate
of theirs. They promised, and being very tired, I then lay down
and fell asleep. I was so worn out, that I did not wake till the
next morning, when I found that we were under all sail running
down to the southward. I saw the Jolly Rover, as I had termed
him, on deck (his real or assumed name, I don&rsquo;t know which, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
found out to be Toplift), sitting on a gun abaft. He called me to
him. I said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for want of a better. I told you months
ago what we were, so it&rsquo;s no use repeating it. Do you intend to
join us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I will be very candid with you. I have
been driven as it were on board of your vessel, but certainly
without knowing exactly what she was. Now, captain, I have to
ask you one question:&mdash;Would you, if you could go on shore in
England, with plenty of money at your command, and plenty of
good friends,&mdash;would you be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; certainly not,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I am in that position. If once in England, I have
money enough to live upon, and plenty of friends; I therefore
naturally want to get back to England, and not to run the risk of
my neck on board of this vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but there are other considerations;
my men won&rsquo;t have a man on board who will not
swear fidelity, and if you will not, I cannot protect you,&mdash;they
will throw you overboard. We don&rsquo;t carry passengers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true, also; and I will swear fidelity so far as
this, that you never shall be betrayed by me, and I never will
appear as a witness against one of you; it were most ungrateful
if I did. While I am on board, I will do any duty you please to
put me to, for I cannot expect to eat my bread for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And suppose we come to action?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the difficulty,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;against an English ship
I never will fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if we are opposed to any other nation, and there is a
chance of our being overpowered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, if you are overpowered, as I shall be hung
along with the rest, I think I must do all I can to save my own
life; but, overpowered or not, I will not fire a shot or draw a cutlass
against my own countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I cannot deny but that&rsquo;s all very fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;it is as much as you can expect;
especially as I never will share any prize-money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I will talk to the men, and hear what they say; but,
now, answer me one question&mdash;Are you not a seaman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will answer the truth to every thing; I am a seaman, and
I have commanded a privateer. I have served many years in
privateers, and have seen a great deal of hard fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;and now answer me another
question,&mdash;Was it not you that played that trick to that French
privateer captain at Bordeaux?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes it was,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but how came you to know
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was the mate of a merchant vessel that had been
captured, and I saw you three or four times as you passed the
vessel I was on board of; for, being put in quarantine, we were
not sent to prison till the pratique was given. I thought that I
knew you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I have no concealment to make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No: but I will tell you candidly, my men, if they knew
all this, would not allow you to leave the vessel. Indeed, you
might be captain if you pleased, for I do not suit them. Our
captain&mdash;for I was his officer&mdash;was killed about six months
ago; and I really am not fit for the office&mdash;I am too tender-hearted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; you don&rsquo;t look so,&rdquo; replied I, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t judge of outsides,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a fact.
They say that they will be all condemned if taken, from my not
destroying the crews of the vessels we take; that they will be so
many witnesses against them; and I cannot make up my mind to
cold-blooded murder. I am bad enough; I rob on the high seas;
I kill on the high seas&mdash;for we must kill when we fight; but I
cannot commit deliberate murder either at sea or on shore, and
so I tell them. If any one else could navigate the vessel, I should
be superseded immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say what you have, captain, it makes
me less dissatisfied at finding myself here. Well; I have said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
all I can, and I must trust to you to manage with your ship&rsquo;s
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a difficult job,&rdquo; said he, musing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;that I was once a captain of a vessel
like this (after all, there is not so much difference between a
pirate and privateer as you may think)&mdash;and that I will not be
under the command of any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they hear that, they will give you the command of this
vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will refuse to take it; and give my reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I&rsquo;ll tell them that: I leave you to settle with them
how you can; but,&rdquo; added he, in a low tone; &ldquo;there are some
desperate villains among them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I take for granted,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;so now I leave you to
speak to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toplift did so. He told them that I was a pirate captain, who
had lost his vessel and been thrown on shore, but I refused to
join any ship except as captain of her; that I would not serve as
first officer, and would obey no one. He told them that he knew
me before, and he narrated the business at Bordeaux when I
commanded a privateer, extolling me, as I afterwards found,
beyond all measure.</p>

<p>The crew, having heard what he had to say, went forward,
and, after consultation, came to Toplift and said that I must
take the oath.</p>

<p>Toplift replied that he had desired me so to do, and that I had
answered that I would not. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you had better
speak to him yourselves. Call all hands aft and hear what he has
to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done, and I was sent for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told them what you said, Sir. I don&rsquo;t know your
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no name,&rdquo; replied I, proudly, &ldquo;except &lsquo;Captain&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact is, Madam, I was determined to carry it out bravely;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
knowing that it is the best way to deal with such people as I now
had in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Captain, I have told the men that you will not
take the oath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the oath,&rdquo; replied I, with scorn; &ldquo;no; I administer
the oath to others. I make them take it. I make them swear
fidelity to me. Such has been my conduct, and I shall not depart
from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but, Captain Toplift, you don&rsquo;t mean to say that he
is to remain on board with us and not take the oath,&rdquo; said a surly-looking
ruffian. &ldquo;In spite of you, he shall take the oath, Captain
Toplift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Toplift,&rdquo; said I, calmly, &ldquo;do you allow one of
your crew to use such language as this. Had I been captain of
this ship, I would have blown his brains out as he stood. You
don&rsquo;t know to deal with these rascals. I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Toplift, who appeared much pleased at being supported
in this way by me&mdash;(strange that a single individual,
whom they might have thrown overboard in a minute, should
have gained such an ascendency, but so it was)&mdash;and who perceived
that the men fell back, as if taken by surprise, then said,
&ldquo;Captain, you have taught me a good lesson, which I will take
advantage of. Seize that fellow and put him in irons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; cried the man, seeing that no one touched him:
&ldquo;who is to bell the cat! hah!&rdquo; and he drew his cutlass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, then,&rdquo; said I to Captain Toplift, &ldquo;if you desire it;&rdquo;
and, stepping forward, I went up to the man, saying, &ldquo;Come,
come, my good fellow, this won&rsquo;t do here; I&rsquo;m used to deal
with such chaps as you, and I can manage worse than you, a good
deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I advanced till I was within the stroke of his cutlass before he
was aware of it, and, seizing him by the waist, I threw him flat
on his back and put my foot on his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried I, in an authoritative voice, &ldquo;put this man in
irons immediately&mdash;refuse who dares. Here, you Sirs, lay hold
of this fellow,&rdquo; continued I, looking to the Portuguese; who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
accordingly came forward and led him away, assisted by others,
who now joined them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any more mutineers here?&rdquo; inquired I; &ldquo;if so,
let them step forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one stirred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lads,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is very true that I have refused to take
the oath, for the oath is not given to those who command, but to
those who obey; but at the same time I am not one to betray you.
You know who I am; and is it likely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; asked one of them, who had been most forward and
insolent, &ldquo;will you be our captain?&mdash;say but the word,&mdash;you
are the sort of man we want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a captain already,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and in a few weeks
I shall command a vessel of my own; I cannot, therefore, accept
your offer; but while I am on board I will do all in my power to
assist Captain Toplift in any way, and you can desire no more.
And now, my men, as an old hand, I have but this advice to give
you, which is&mdash;to return to your duty; for every thing in a vessel
of this description depends upon obedience; and to you, Captain
Toplift, I have also advice to give, which is&mdash;to shoot the first
man who behaves as that scoundrel did who is now in irons.
Boatswain! pipe down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hardly knew whether this latter order would be obeyed by
the boatswain, or, if obeyed by the boatswain, whether it would
be obeyed by the men; but, to my great satisfaction, it was; and
the men retired peaceably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain Toplift,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have done you no harm,
and myself some good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have indeed,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;come down into the cabin.&rdquo;
When we were in the cabin he said, &ldquo;You have unarmed and
subdued the most mutinous rascal in the vessel, and you have
strengthened my authority. They fully believe you are what you
assert from your behaviour, and I feel, with you at my side, I
shall get on better with these fellows than I have done. But now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg&nbsp;265]</a></span>
to keep up the idea, you must, of course, mess in the cabin with
me, and I can offer you clothes, not my own, but those of the
former captain, which will suit your shape and make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I readily agreed with him; and having equipped myself in the
clothes he offered me, which were handsome, I soon afterwards
went on deck with him, and received the greatest respect from the
men as I passed them. A cot was slung for me in the cabin, and
I lived altogether with Captain Toplift, who was a good-hearted,
rough sort of a man, certainly wholly unfit for the command of a
vessel manned by such a set of miscreants, and employed on
such a service. He told me that he had been taken three years
before by a pirate vessel, and finding that he could navigate, they
had detained him by force, and that at last he had become accustomed
to his position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all must live,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I had no other means of
livelihood left me; but it&rsquo;s sorely against my conscience, and
that&rsquo;s the truth. However, I am used to it now, and that reconciles
you to any thing, except murder in cold blood, and that I
never will consent to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On my inquiring where they were about to cruise, he said on
the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is peace with the Spaniards just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly knew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was peace. Not that peace
makes any difference to us, for we take every thing; but you refer
to myself, I know, and I tell you frankly that I have preferred this
cruise merely that we may not fall in with English vessels, which
we are not likely to do there. I wish I was out of her with all my
heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, Captain Toplift; I think you are sincere.
Suppose you put into one of the inlets of Jamaica, they won&rsquo;t
know where we are; let us take a boat on shore and leave her.
I will provide for you, and you shall gain your living in an honest
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Sir,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I will try what I can do. We
must talk the matter over, for they may suspect something, and
then it would be all over with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
We continued to run down till we were in the latitude of the
Virgin Isles, and then we altered her course for Jamaica. The
first and second mates generally received information of Captain
Toplift as to his movements and intentions, which they communicated
to the crew. If the crew disapproved of them, they
said so, and they were considered to have some voice in the
matter.</p>

<p>Now, although no navigators, these men knew enough of a
chart and a course to find that there must be some reason for its
being altered as it was, instead of running down by the Spanish
Main, and they inquired why the cruise was altered.</p>

<p>Captain Toplift replied that he had taken my advice, and that
I had assured him that at the back of the island of Jamaica we
should certainly fall in with some rich Spanish vessels, if we lay
there quiet in some nook or another for a short time, as this was
their time for coming up from the south to the Havannah, where
they rendezvoused for a convoy.</p>

<p>This reply appeared very satisfactory to the crew, for they
were all cheerful and obedient, and we ran down to Jamaica,
and when we were close in shore, we shortened sail and hove to.
We remained three or four days in the offing, that we might not
cause any suspicion by our leaving too soon. Captain Toplift
then told the mates that I proposed anchoring in some secret bay
or inlet, as we were certain to see the Spanish ships if we could
send any one ashore on the hills to look out for them. This was
agreed to, and we made sail and ran along the coast, looking
out for some convenient anchorage.</p>

<p>As we were so doing, a vessel hove in sight, and we immediately
made all sail in chase. As she did not attempt to avoid
us, we hauled off as she came near, to see what she might be.
She then hoisted a yellow flag at her peak (for she was an
hermaphrodite brig); this puzzled us not a little, and we edged
down towards her, for she was very rakish-looking, except in
her sails.</p>

<p>As we neared, finding I suppose that we did not answer her
signals, and we were not the vessel she expected us to be, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
suddenly altered her course before the wind, setting all the sail
that she possibly could. We immediately crowded canvas in
chase, and came up with her fast. As we ran, the mate and I
looked at her through the glass, and I made her out to be the
Transcendant, the captain of which had treated us so cruelly
when we were in the boat, and who had robbed us of our money
and clothes. I called the Portuguese and desired them to look
at the vessel through the glass, and give me their opinion. They
directly said that it was the vessel I supposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us only catch the rascal,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and we will pay him
in his own coin;&rdquo; and I immediately gave directions for the
better trimming of the sails, so anxious was I to come up with
him.</p>

<p>The men of the schooner were much pleased at the anxiety I
displayed to come up with the chase, and by the alacrity with
which they obeyed me, I saw how anxious they were that I should
be their captain. In two hours we were within gun-shot, and
sent one of our bow-chasers after him. Perceiving that it was
useless to run, the fellow hove to, and as we came alongside,
he was all ready with his boat to come on board. He did so, and
at first I kept out of sight to hear what he would say. He was
followed up the side by his amiable son. Captain Toplift received
him on deck, and he looked around him, saying, &ldquo;I believe
I am right. I was afraid I had made more mistakes than
one. I believe you are in the free trade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Toplift, &ldquo;we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought so, captain, but I expected to meet another
schooner which is very like to yours, and is also in the trade.
I made my signal to her, as, when she has any thing to get rid
of, why I take it off her hands. Perhaps you may have something
of the kind which is not exactly safe to show,&mdash;church-plate and
the like. I pay ready money&mdash;that&rsquo;s my plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it afterwards appeared, Madam, this scoundrel had been
in the free trade, or pirating, himself for many years, but he
had taken an opportunity of walking off with a large sum of money
belonging to the pirate crew, and with this money he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
purchased his property in Virginia and the brig which he now commanded.
Although he did not follow up the free trade any more,
he had made arrangements with a pirate captain whom he met at
Port Royal to meet them at the back of the island and receive
such articles as the pirate might want to turn into cash, by which
he, of course, took care to secure large profits.</p>

<p>This he had done several times, and as he sold his cargo at
Port Royal for dollars, he had always cash to pay for what the
pirate wished to get rid of. But he had now run into the lion&rsquo;s
jaws, for not only were I and the Portuguese on board to denounce
him as a robber, but, what was still more unfortunate for him,
three of the pirate&rsquo;s crew, whom he had swindled out of their
property, were also on board of us, and recognized him immediately.</p>

<p>As Captain Toplift knew how I had been treated by him, he
thought it was time he should be confronted with me, and to his
question as to whether there was any thing to dispose of, he replied
to him, &ldquo;You must put that question to the captain.
There he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow turned to me; he looked at me, stared, and was
mute, when his cub of a boy cried out, &ldquo;As sure as a gun it&rsquo;s
he, father, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you imp of Satan, you know me, do you?&rdquo; replied I.
&ldquo;Yes, it is he. Send all the men aft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men came fast enough. They were only waiting till
I had spoken to them to come and give information against
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my lads,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is a scoundrel who fell in
with some of us when we were in distress, after we had lost our
vessel. Instead of behaving as one seaman does to another, he
robbed us of all we had, and turned us adrift naked to be killed
by the Indians. Of all, I and the two Portuguese you took on
board about four months back are the only three left: the others
perished. The one who was with me was burnt to death by the
Indians, and I narrowly escaped. I leave you to decide what this
scoundrel merits.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
&ldquo;But there is more against him, captain,&rdquo; said the men,
and then four of them stepped out and declared that he had
run away with the money belonging to the crew of which they
were a part, and that the sum he had stolen amounted to 25,000
dollars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you to say for yourself?&rdquo; said I to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I have been a cursed fool to be caught as I have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will they do, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang us, I suppose,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Toplift,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I do not command this vessel,
and I shall therefore leave you to decide upon the fate of this
miscreant;&rdquo; and having said that, I was going below to the cabin,
when the captain of the Transcendant&rsquo;s son ran to me, and said,
&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Sir, when you are alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you after, Peleg?&rdquo; cried his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to save your life, father, if I can,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be clever if you do that, boy,&rdquo; said the man, sneeringly.</p>

<p>I allowed the boy to follow me down into the cabin, and then
asked him what he had to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have that to tell you which is of more value than the lives
of a hundred boys like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys like you? Why I thought it was to save your father&rsquo;s
life that you came down, Sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let him hang; he was born for a halter.
I am come to save my own life. I only said that to gammon
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hopeful youth,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and pray what is that
you can tell me that will save your own neck from the halter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That which will save your own, most likely,&rdquo; replied the
boy, &ldquo;and tit-for-tat&rsquo;s all fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hear it, then,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not unless you promise. I can swing, if need be, as
well as father, but I&rsquo;d rather not, &rsquo;cause I know where all his
money is hidden.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make any promise,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;so I may e&rsquo;en go on deck
and tell father that I cannot manage it;&rdquo; and as he said the latter
part of this speech, the undaunted little villain actually laughed
at the idea of gammoning his father, as he termed it.</p>

<p>Train up a child in the way he should go, and he will not depart
from it, is mostly true; but it is more certain that if you
train a child up in the way that he should not go, he will be a more
true disciple. Could there be a more decided proof of the above
than the behaviour of this young villain? but his father had made
him so, and thus was he rewarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said I, for I had reflected whether, after all, there
were any grounds for hanging the boy, and come to a conclusion
that a jury would have probably acquitted him. &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;you say that what you can tell is of the greatest consequence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And becomes of more consequence every minute that
passes,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I will tell you every thing, and let you
into father&rsquo;s secrets. I peach upon father altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;if what you have to disclose
proves important, I will do all I can to save your life, and I have
no doubt that I shall be able so to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more have I,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;or I would not have come
to you. Now then, father came to the back of the island to do a
little business with a pirate schooner, as he said just now; and
he has very often done it before, as he said just now; but father
did not tell you all. When we were in Port Royal, father went
to the captain of a king&rsquo;s vessel who is there, having been sent to
put down the pirates if possible, and he offered this captain of
the king&rsquo;s ship, for a certain sum, to put our friends that we exchange
with into his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, betray his friend the pirate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father agreed that he would come round as he has done
this day, and would contrive to chaffer and bargain with him and
keep him so late in the bay that the king&rsquo;s ship should come upon
him all of a sudden and take him, and this was father&rsquo;s intention,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
only you have pinned him. The king&rsquo;s ship will be round that
point in two hours or thereabouts, so if you are found here you
will be taken and hanged as sure as I ain&rsquo;t hanged yet. Now ain&rsquo;t
this important news, and worth all I asked for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is, if it is true, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll prove it, for I always goes with father, and he
trusts me with every thing. I saw the paper signed. The king&rsquo;s
ship is called the Vestal, and the captain who signed the paper,
signed it Philip Musgrave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said I, turning away, for I did not wish the boy
to perceive my emotion at this announcement. I recovered myself
as soon as I could, and said to him, &ldquo;Boy, I will keep my
promise. Do you stay below, and I will go on deck and plead for
your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I go on deck for a bit?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, to wish your father good-bye? No, no, you had better
spare yourself and him that painful meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to wish him good-bye; I&rsquo;ll wait till it&rsquo;s
over, only I never did see a man hanged, and I have a curiosity
to have just a peep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out, you little monster,&rdquo; cried I, running up on deck, for
the information I had received was too important not to be immediately
taken advantage of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, captain, has the boy saved his father&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied I, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, up he goes,&rdquo; said the men, for the halter had been
round his neck and run out to the yard-arm for some time, and
the men had manned the rope, only awaiting my return on deck.
In a second, the captain of the Transcendant was swinging in the
air, and certainly if ever a scoundrel merited his fate, it was that
man. Shortly afterwards I turned round, and there was the
young hopeful looking at his father&rsquo;s body swinging to and fro
with the motion of the vessel.</p>

<p>I looked in vain for a tear in his eye; there was not a symptom
of emotion. Seeing me look sternly at him, he hastened
down below again.</p>

&ldquo;My lads,&rdquo; said I to the men, who were all on deck, &ldquo;I have
received intelligence of that importance that I recommend that we
should cut that vessel adrift, and make sail without a moment&rsquo;s
loss of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, not plunder?&rdquo; cried the men, looking at the Transcendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not think of it, if you are wise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this reply all of the men exclaimed that &ldquo;that would not
do&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that plunder they would&rdquo;&mdash;that &ldquo;I was not the captain
of the vessel,&rdquo; and many more expressions showing how soon a
man may lose popularity on board of a pirate vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave my opinion, my men, and if you will hear why I said
so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, out boats,&rdquo; cried they all, and simultaneously ran
to lower down the boats, for it was now calm, that they might tow
the schooner alongside of the Transcendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might as well talk to the wind as talk to them when
there is plunder to be obtained,&rdquo; said Toplift to me in a low
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come down with me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I will tell you what I
have heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they going to plunder the brig?&rdquo; said Master Peleg,
when we came down; &ldquo;I know where father&rsquo;s dollars are,&rdquo; and
up he ran on deck.</p>

<p>I made a short remark upon the depravity of the boy, and then
informed Captain Toplift of what he had told me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had told them, they would not have paid attention to
you. The boat&rsquo;s crew who came with the captain have told them
that there is money on board, and all authority is now at an
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I believe that the boy has told the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you mean to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remain below quietly, if I am allowed,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I cannot,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;they would throw me overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make as bad a fight of it as you can,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said Captain Toplift, &ldquo;and with so superior
a force opposed, we cannot stand long. But I must tell you where
you must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the entrance of the magazine, for as sure as we stand
here they will blow up the vessel rather than be taken. Not all of
them, but two or three I know are determined so to do, and resolute
enough to do it. My pistols are there. You have only to
open this door, and you are in the magazine passage. See,&rdquo; said
he, opening the door, &ldquo;there is the scuttle where they hand the
powder up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be on the watch, depend upon it; and, Captain Toplift,
if the schooner is taken, and I am alive, you may have no
fear for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let us go on deck again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will follow you,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am alone at last, thank Heaven!&rdquo; said I to myself. &ldquo;What
a position am I in, and how much will be in suspense before
twenty-four hours are over. My own brother here, not ten miles
perhaps from me, commanding the vessel which will attack this
on which I am on board. That they will take us I have no doubt;
but what risk do I run&mdash;of death by shot, or by their blowing up
the vessel in spite of me, or of no quarter being given. Well, I
wish it were decided. At all events, I am long supposed dead,
and I shall not be recognized among the heaps of bodies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then went to the locker and took out my duck frock and
trowsers, determining that I would, if I were killed, be killed in
those clothes, and be thrown overboard as a common seaman. I
then went on deck, for I had heard the grating of the sides of the
two vessels and knew that they were in contact.</p>

<p>All was uproar and confusion on board of the Transcendant,
but there was nobody on board the schooner except Toplift and
myself. I cannot say that I never saw such a scene, for I had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
seen quite as bad on board of a privateer. The common seamen,
as well as the soldiers, when let loose to plunder, are like
maniacs. In half an hour they had broken open every thing, cut
the crew to pieces, found out the hoard of dollars, which was
shown them by young Peleg, who tried for his share, but for so
doing received a chop with a cutlass, which cut off his right ear,
and wounded him severely on the shoulder; but his right arm
was not disabled, and while the man that cut him down was
bending over a heap of dollars, which took both hands to lift
them, the boy ran his knife deep into the man&rsquo;s side, who fell
mortally wounded. The rush for the dollars thus at the mercy of
the rest was so great, that Peleg was not minded, and he crept
away and came on board the schooner. We saw that he was
bleeding profusely, but we asked no questions, and he went
down the ladder forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has that young villain been after?&rdquo; said Toplift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume he has been quarrelling for plunder, and considered
that he had a greater right to his father&rsquo;s money than anybody
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among other plunder the people had not forgotten to look for
liquor, and an hour had not passed before three-fourths of the
men were more or less intoxicated. They had found plenty of
good clothes, and were strutting about with gold-laced waistcoats
and embroidered coats over their dirty frocks. The uproar
increased every minute, when Toplift, who had been looking
out with the glass, exclaimed, &ldquo;There she is, by all that&rsquo;s
sacred!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I caught the glass out of his hand, and found it was the king&rsquo;s
ship. She was a large flush vessel, apparently of eighteen or
twenty guns, just opening from the point, and not seven miles
from us. We were still becalmed, and she was bringing the
wind down with her, so that to escape appeared impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what shall we do?&rdquo; said Captain Toplift; &ldquo;shall we
allow her to come down upon us and say nothing to the men, or
shall we point out the danger, and persuade them to come on
board and prepare?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
&ldquo;You must do as you please,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I am indifferent
which. It will be dark in another hour, and she will not be
down by that time. I would rather avoid fighting, and get away
from the schooner quietly if I could, but that I fear is impossible
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must go on board of the brig and let them know,
for if they find it out themselves, they will throw us overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Toplift then went on board of the brig, and calling to
the men who were still sober, told them that there was a king&rsquo;s
ship coming down upon them not seven miles off. This had the
effect of putting an end to the confusion and noise of a great portion
of the men, who hastened on board of the schooner, but
others, who were intoxicated, were with difficulty persuaded to
return.</p>

<p>At last they were all got on board, and the schooner, clear
from the brig, was made ready for action; but Toplift was
obliged to make some alteration in the stationing of the men, as
those who were to hand up the powder were all of them tipsy. By
the time that the schooner was ready, and the breeze had come
down to her, the corvette was not more than three miles from us;
but it was quite dark, for there is no twilight in those parts. We
consulted what course we should take to avoid her, if possible,
and agreed that we would stand in shore and pass her if we possibly
could. We knew that, if seen, we were then certain to be
obliged to fight; but if not seen, we might escape.</p>

<p>We then shifted the helm and bore up across her bows, but
we had not steered in this direction more than a quarter of an
hour, when the Transcendant was perceived to be on fire, having
been fired by the drunken men before they left her, and soon
afterwards she burst out into flames that threw a strong light to a
great distance, discovering the corvette to us at two miles&rsquo;
distance, and of course exposing us to the corvette, who immediately
altered her course for us. We had therefore only to
fight, and the crew, being most of them in liquor, declared that
they would fight till the schooner sunk under them. In a quarter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
of an hour, the corvette being close to us, and standing stem on,
we opened our fire, raking her masts and yards, and then I went
down below. I had changed my clothes for the duck trowsers
and shirt which I had swum on board in, and I now remained
quietly in the cabin. A few minutes afterwards the corvette
opened her fire, and the shot did great execution. The cries of
the wounded and the shouts of the tipsy men were mingled together,
but the crew of the schooner tired with great rapidity, and
sustained the unequal conflict most gallantly.</p>

<p>After a time some men darted down into the cabin. I was
then at the door which led to the magazine passage, and busied
myself handing up the powder, as it secured me from observation,
and it was supposed that I was one of the crew sent down for
that duty.</p>

<p>The men roared out, &ldquo;Where is the captain? We want him
to fight the ship. Toplift is an old fool, and don&rsquo;t know what he
is about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no reply, but with my back towards them continued
to hand up the powder, and, having changed my dress, they did
not recognize me, so they rushed upon deck again.</p>

<p>The corvette was now alongside of the schooner, pouring in
her broadsides with fatal execution, the shot passing in every
direction through her, so that there was as much danger below
as on deck, and it was evident that the schooner could not oppose
them much longer. Still they continued to fire with great resolution,
being now sobered into more steadiness than at first. But
by this time more than half the men were killed and wounded,
and our guns were encumbered with the wreck and bodies. I
heard them, at the very time that a crashing broadside was poured
in by the corvette, cry out, &ldquo;Avast firing for a moment and clear
the decks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did so, and having thrown the bodies overboard and
cut away the spars and rigging which had fallen, so as to enable
them to work their guns, during which time three broadsides
were poured in, they remanned their guns, and fought with as
much spirit as before. I could not help admiring the courage of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
the scoundrels, for nothing could exceed it; but resistance was
useless, further than they preferred dying at their guns to being
hanged on the gibbet.</p>

<p>But the shouts of the pirates and the reports of the guns gradually
decreased. The men were swept away by the enemy&rsquo;s
fire, and the guns were one by one disabled. The schooner&rsquo;s
sides were torn out, and the water poured in below so fast that
it was rising to the magazine. I heard a cry of boarders, and
the striking of the two vessels together, and then there was a rush
down below, when a man came aft to the magazine passage. It
was the fellow whom I had struck down on the quarter-deck and
had put into irons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said he, to the others; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll send the corvette
and ourselves all to the devil together. Out of the way
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; replied he, pointing his pistol down to the
magazine.</p>

<p>I threw up his arm, and the pistol went off, striking the
beams above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blast you,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;whoever you are; but I&rsquo;ve another,&rdquo;
and he attempted to draw it out of his belt, but before he could
effect it I blew out his brains with the pistol which I had ready
cocked in my hand.</p>

<p>His companions started back, and I pointed my second pistol
at them, saying, &ldquo;The man who comes forward this way
dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I said this the crew of the corvette, who had cleared the
decks, charged down below, and the pirates ran away and secreted
themselves. Perceiving them coming forward, I said to
them, &ldquo;Put a guard over the magazine; they have attempted to
blow up the vessel already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said an officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A prisoner,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, lead him on deck, and stay here, two of you;
shut down the magazine scuttle and keep guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thank Heaven,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;that this affair is over,&rdquo; as a
seaman led me by the collar on deck, and handed me to others,
who took me on board of the corvette.</p>

<p>We were all put down below that remained out of the schooner&rsquo;s
crew, about eighteen or nineteen, not more, and I was
glad to find Captain Toplift, although badly wounded with a
splinter, was among the number. We remained there huddled
together with a guard of ten men over us for more than an hour,
when we heard, from the conversation on deck, that the schooner
had sunk. After that the guns of the corvette were secured,
and the men had an allowance of liquor served out to them, the
watch was called, and all was quiet during the remainder of that
night. For some time I was in a state of excitement from the
events of the last twenty-four hours crowding so rapidly, but by
degrees I became calm. I asked one of the guard who was the
captain of the corvette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you, you gallows-bird?&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A civil question might receive a civil reply,&rdquo; answered I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it might with any one else; but if you don&rsquo;t want
the hilt of my cutlass down your throat, you will hold your
tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I did not require to repeat the question, as I heard
one of the officers on deck say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Captain Musgrave&rsquo;s
orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This satisfied me, and I lay down with the rest of the prisoners,
waiting for daybreak, when I trusted my troubles would
soon be over. They were all sound asleep. Strange that men
who knew that they would be hanged In a few days, if not the
next morning, should sleep so sound&mdash;but so it was&mdash;while I,
who had every reason to believe that my sufferings were over,
could not sleep one wink. I was, however, fully satisfied with
my own castle-buildings during the night, and more satisfied
when it was again broad daylight. After the men had had their
breakfast, an order came down for all the prisoners to be brought
on deck. We were led up under guard, and made to stand all
in a row. I looked round for my brother, but he was not on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
deck. It was the first lieutenant who was there, with several
other officers, and the clerk, with pen and ink, to take down
the names of the prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was the captain of this vessel?&rdquo; said the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was, Sir,&rdquo; replied Toplift; &ldquo;but much against my
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course; every man was on board of her against his
will. What is your name? Put him down, Mr. Pearson. Any
other officers alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; replied Toplift.</p>

<p>The name of every man was then asked and put down, and it
so happened that I was the last; for, anxious to see my brother,
I had walked up the foremost, and they had commenced their interrogation
at the other end of the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not belong to the schooner,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not; you dropped on board her from the
clouds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir, I did not; I swam on board of her to save my
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you went out of the frying-pan into the fire, I reckon,
my good fellow, for your life is forfeited now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think not, Sir,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;On the contrary, I
feel it is quite safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us none of your jaw, my good fellow, but give us your
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Sir, if you require it. My name is Alexander
Musgrave, Sir,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I am the elder brother of your
captain, Philip Musgrave, and I will thank you to go into his
cabin and inform him that I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first lieutenant and officers started back in astonishment,
and so did Captain Toplift and the pirates. The first lieutenant
hardly knew whether to consider it as a pretence on my part or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
not, and was undecided how to act, when Captain Toplift said,
&ldquo;I do not know whether the gentleman is as he says, but this is
certain, and all the men can prove it as well as myself, that he
did swim on board, as he said, to escape from the Indians, and
that he has never joined the crew. They offered to make him
captain in my stead, and he positively refused it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said all the pirates; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s true enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir,&rdquo; replied the first lieutenant, &ldquo;I will certainly
carry your message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make all certain,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I will write my name on
a slip of paper for you to take in to the captain. He knows my
signature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did so, and the first lieutenant took the paper, and went
into the cabin. In a minute he returned, and requested me to
follow him. I did so, and in another minute I was in the arms
of my brother. For some time we neither of us could speak. At
last Philip said, &ldquo;That you are alive and well, let me thank
Heaven. I have considered you as dead, and so have others;
and to find you on board of a pirate&mdash;on board of a vessel which
I have been riddling with shot, any one of which might have
caused your death. Thank God I was ignorant that you were on
board, or I never could have done my duty. I will not ask how
you came on board of this vessel, for that must be the end of your
narrative, which I must have from the time that you first left Rio,
and afterwards in detail the whole from the time that you left the
Coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they received my letters from Rio?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, after imagining you were dead, they were rejoiced by
those letters; but I will not anticipate my story, nor will I now
ask for yours; it is sufficient at present that you are alive, my
dear Alexander, and once more in my arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me ask one question,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what it will be. She was in good health, but
suffering much in mind from having no account of you. Her
father and others have reasoned with her, and painted the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span>
impossibility of your being in existence, as the xebeque you sailed
in had never been heard of. She still adheres in the opinion that
you are alive, and will not abandon the hope of seeing you again;
but hope deferred has paled her cheek even more pale than it
usually is, and she evidently suffers much, for her life is wrapped
in yours. Now having told you this, you must come into my
state-room, and allow me to enable you to appear as my brother
ought to do. I do not think that there is any difference in our size
now, although there was when we last parted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many thanks, Philip, but before I adonize my outward man
I should wish to satisfy my inward cravings; and, to tell you the
truth, I&rsquo;m so hungry from not having broken my fast for nearly
twenty-four hours, that if you could order something to eat while
you are looking out the clothes, I should feel in no small degree
grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip rang the bell and ordered the steward in bring something
to eat and drink, and after eating I occupied a quarter of an
hour more in getting rid of the pirate smoke and dirt, and putting
on one of his uniforms, for he had no other clothes on board,
when I came out, looking not at all like a pirate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;before we have our <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
come out with me, and let me introduce you to the officers as my
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went out with him, and was formally introduced. The first
lieutenant apologized for his rough speech, but I told him that
there was no occasion for any apology, as I had no doubt that I
looked very much like a pirate at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than you do now. Sir, at all events,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the bye, brother,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is one man among the
prisoners who, although compelled to act as captain by the men,
is no pirate. His conduct I will explain to you. May I request
him to be kindly treated? His name is Toplift&mdash;and also two
Portuguese, my former companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Philip, &ldquo;your word is sufficient. Let
those persons be released and taken care of,&rdquo; said he to the
first lieutenant. &ldquo;We will wait for the particulars by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
I remained on deck about ten minutes, and then returned to
the cabin with my brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this which you have left on my dressing-table?&rdquo;
said Philip, surveying the leather bag which contained the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, Philip,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is a portion of my narrative, and
eventually may prove a very important one. I don&rsquo;t think that I
can afford to make you a present of it, but I shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not look very valuable,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events, do me the favour to lock it up carefully,&rdquo;
replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you are in earnest I will,&rdquo; he said, and having
put it in a drawer and locked it up, he said, &ldquo;Now, Alexander,
let me have your history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I commenced, and told him all that the reader is now acquainted
with. Dinner broke off my narrative, and as soon as it
was over I resumed it. When I had finished, he expressed his
astonishment, and asked many questions. Among others he
said, &ldquo;And that little wretch Peleg, the captain of the Transcendant&rsquo;s
son, is he on board?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen him,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and therefore presume
that he was not able to move, and went down in the schooner.&rdquo;
Which was the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have indeed told me a strange tale,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;and
you have had some extraordinary escapes. You must have a
charmed life, and you appear to have been preserved to prove
that Amy&rsquo;s persuasion of your being still alive was just and well-founded;
and now it is my turn to talk, and yours to listen.
When I left you as lieutenant of Captain Levee&rsquo;s schooner, we
very shortly afterwards had an action with a Spanish vessel of
very superior force, for she mounted thirty guns. Having no
chance with her, from her superior weight of metal, we threw
ourselves on her bow and boarded. The Spaniards did not relish
this kind of close fighting, and gave us immediate possession of
their deck. Captain Levee, when he brought in his prize, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
appointed to a frigate of thirty-six guns, and I followed him as
his first lieutenant. We had another combat with a vessel of
equal force, in which we were the victors, and I was sent in the
prize. Captain Levee wrote very kindly in my behalf, and I was
made a captain, and given the command of a small brig. But let
me first finish with Captain Levee. He captured a galleon, which
gave him a large fortune, and he then gave up the command of
his ship, and went on shore, telling me in a letter that he had
hitherto squandered away all his money, but now that he had got
so much, he intended to keep it. He has done so, for he has
purchased a large landed property, is married, and I believe, is
very happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He deserves it,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;and long may he be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to continue. I was sent out on this station, and
having information that the vessel which you are now on board of
was at anchor in a bay close to the Havannah, I ran in and reconnoitred.
She hoisted Spanish colours, and I did the same.
It fell calm, and I lay about four miles outside. I was mistaken
for another Spanish vessel, and the captain of this vessel, or, to
speak correctly, the Spanish captain of the Spanish brig, came
out to see me, and did not discover his mistake till he was on
board. I detained him and his boat&rsquo;s crew. It continued calm
till the evening, when the breeze sprung up, and I put the head
of the brig right for the bay, as if I were going in to anchor. The
breeze being light, it was dark before I got in and alongside this
vessel. They were completely surprised, for they imagined that
their captain was dining with his old friend, and having no idea
that we were any thing but Spanish, had not the least preparation
for resistance. We had possession of her decks before they
could seize their arms, and I brought her out without any one
knowing that she had been captured. On my arrival, the admiral
gave me the command of her, which I have held for nine months;
but she is very defective, and I was ordered home, and should
have sailed, had it not been that that scoundrel, the captain of the
Transcendant, gave me the information which induced me to
come round to the back of the island. Little did I think what
happiness awaited me. So much for myself. Do not think me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span>
an egotist for speaking of myself, I am only clearing away the less
important information to arrive at that which most interests you.
The Amy arrived safe with her valuable cargo. The captain reported
that he had remained at the rendezvous until blown off by
a sort of hurricane, and that finding himself a long way off, he
considered, when the gale had ceased, that he was not justified
in remaining with so valuable a cargo, but was bound to make
the best of his way to Liverpool. He was right, and his conduct
was approved of by Mr. Trevannion, who looked for your arrival
every hour. At last a week passed away and you did not make
your appearance, and great alarm was entertained for your
safety. The weeks grew into months, and it was supposed that
you had been upset in the same hurricane which had driven the
Amy so far off from her rendezvous. The poor girl, Whyna, was,
as you may suppose, kindly received by Mr. Trevannion and his
daughter, and soon gained their affection; but she pined for your
return, and when she was told that you were dead she never recovered
it. The climate certainly did not agree with her, and
she contracted a very bad cough during the winter, but I believe
from my heart that it was your loss which affected her the most
severely. After she had been about eighteen months in England,
she fell into a consumption and died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Whyna!&rdquo; said I, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexander,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;perhaps it was all for the best,
for that poor girl loved you sincerely, and supposing that she
was now still alive and living with Miss Trevannion, and on your
return your marriage should (which of course, unless Heaven
decrees otherwise, it will) take place, that poor creature would
have been very unhappy; and although the idea of her being a
rival to Miss Trevannion is something which may appear absurd
to us, yet she had the same feelings, and must have endured the
same pangs as any other woman, let her colour be what it may.
I think, therefore, that her removal was a blessing and a happy
dispensation. I saw Mr. Trevannion and his daughter but once
previous to their receiving your letters from Rio acquainting
them with your misfortunes and happy deliverance from slavery.
They were both very dejected, and Mr. Trevannion talked of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span>
retiring from business, and living upon his property near Liverpool.
As I corresponded regularly with Amy, I learnt that he
had done so, and had just wound up his affairs when your letters
arrived from Rio with an order on the Portuguese Exchequer for a
considerable sum. I hardly need say that the joy occasioned by
this intelligence was great. Amy recovered her good looks, and
her father bitterly lamented his having retired from business, as
he had wished to have made the whole over to you. The money
you remitted from Rio he considered as your own, and he also
set apart your share of the business from the time that you were
admitted as a partner. He was not aware that you could carry a
diamond of such immense value about your person, exposed to
the view of every one; among Indians, settlers, and pirates.
That my delight was equal to theirs you will, I am sure, give me
credit to believe; and although I was obliged to sail for the West
Indies, every day I anticipated receiving a letter informing me of
your arrival in England. Judge then my distress at first receiving
letters stating that you had not been heard of for three months
after your leaving Rio, and expressions of fear that some accident
had happened, and then month after month many more and
more desponding letters, in which Mr. Trevannion plainly stated
that the xebeque must have foundered; and only Amy clinging to
the hope that you were still alive. I acknowledge that I considered
you dead, and you may therefore imagine my surprise and
delight when your signature on the slip of paper proved that you
were not only in existence, but on board of the same vessel
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the narrative of my brother Philip in return for
mine, and it was late at night when we parted. Oh! how sincerely
did I pray that night, thanking Heaven for all its mercies,
and entreating that the cup might not be again dashed from my
lips. When I arose the next morning I found that Philip was on
deck, and I followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall soon be in Port Royal with this wind,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I hope to find the admiral still there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had some conversation with the officers, and then went below
to see Toplift. He was in his hammock, for he had much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
fever and suffered from his wound, but the surgeon said that he
would do well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toplift,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you must keep your mind at ease, for
my brother has promised me that you shall not be tried with the
others, and has no doubt that when he explains the whole to the
admiral you will be thanked for your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanked!&rdquo; said Toplift, &ldquo;if I am not hanged, I shall be
fortunate enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fear of that,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;so keep your mind easy and
get well as fast as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, Sir, you have saved my life, at all events, for
had you not come on board, no one would have ever spoken for
me, or believed that I was not a pirate in heart like all the others,
except the two Portuguese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If necessary, they will be evidence in your favour, but I do
not think any evidence will be required except mine, and that will
be sufficient with the admiral. I promised you that you should
never want the means of getting your livelihood, and I repeat that
promise now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sir,&rdquo; replied he, and I then left him and went
up to the cabin to breakfast.</p>

<p>The following day we were at anchor at Port Royal; my
brother reported what had occurred, and the admiral sent for all
the pirate prisoners except Toplift, whose case was so fully represented
by me and my brother, that he was permitted to go at
large, and to take a passage home to England free of expense if
he wished it. It is hardly necessary to say that Toplift accepted
this offer, and remained in the vessel with me. The two Portuguese
were also liberated. Three days after our arrival we
sailed for England, and after a quick run of between five and six
weeks, we anchored at Spithead. My brother could not leave
his ship, and I therefore requested him to write to Liverpool
stating that he had intelligence of me, and that I was alive; that
I had been wrecked and had fallen into the hands of the Indians
near the English settlements in Virginia, and that I had escaped
and was, he believed, at James Town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
I considered it wise to make a communication like this at
first, as too sudden an announcement might be dangerous to one
in so weak a state of health as Philip stated my Amy to be from
the letter he had received from her father. I remained with him
at Portsmouth until the reply came. Mr. Trevannion wrote and
told Philip that his communication had, as it were, raised his
daughter from the grave&mdash;as she had fallen into a state of profound
melancholy, which nothing could remove&mdash;that he had
very cautiously introduced the subject, and by degrees told her
what was reported, and eventually when he found that she was
more composed, that he had put Philip&rsquo;s letter into her hand.</p>

<p>He concluded that he trusted that I would arrive, and soon,
for if any accident was now to happen to me it would be the death
of his daughter, who had not strength enough left to bear another
reverse. At my request Philip then wrote that he had received a
letter from a brother officer stating that I was well and safe on
board, and that they would be in England a few days after the
receipt of the letter.</p>

<p>Leaving directions to Philip how to proceed, I now went off
to London, and having fitted myself out with every requisite of
dress and toilet, I called upon a celebrated Jew diamond merchant
and showed him my diamond, requesting that he would
weigh it and then estimate its value. He was much astonished at
the sight of such a stone, as well he might be, and after weighing
it and examining it, he pronounced it worth &pound;47,000, provided
a purchaser could be found for an article of such value.</p>

<p>I told him that I was not a merchant, and could not be travelling
about to show the diamond to crowned heads, but if he
would give me a liberal price for it, I would abate a great deal,
that he might dispose of it to his own advantage. He requested
that he might call upon me with two of his friends, that they
might see the diamond and consult with him; and then he would
give me an answer. We fixed the time for twelve o&rsquo;clock on the
following day, and I took my leave.</p>

<p>The next day he called at the time appointed, accompanied
by two gentlemen of his own persuasion. They weighed the stone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
again very carefully, examined it by the light of a powerful lamp
to ascertain its water, and to see if there were any flaws in it,
calculated the reduction of weight which would take place in
cutting it, and, after a consultation, I was offered &pound;38,000.
I considered this an offer that I ought not to refuse, and I closed
with them. The next day the affair was settled. I received money
and bills on government to the amount, and wrote to Philip telling
him what had taken place. Strange that from two slaves in the
mines I should have received such valuable legacies; from poor
Ingram a diamond worth so much money, and from the other
Englishman a tattered Bible which made me a sincere Christian&mdash;a
legacy in comparison of which the diamond was as
dross.</p>

<p>Philip replied to my letter congratulating me on the sale of the
diamond, and informing me that to his letter he had received a
reply containing so satisfactory an account of Amy&rsquo;s restored
health, that he had written to tell them that I had arrived safe in
England, and would be very soon with them. He recommended
my going immediately, as the anxiety and suspense would be
very injurious to Amy&rsquo;s health. I therefore made every arrangement
for my departure, purchased horses, and procured four
stout serving men, well armed, to accompany me, and wrote a
letter, which I sent by an express courier, stating the exact day
which I expected to arrive at Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s country seat.</p>

<p>I waited in London two days to wind up all my affairs, and to
give time for the express to arrive before me, as I intended to
travel very fast. My stay in London was the occasion of an important
discovery. I was at the coffee-house at St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
was talking with one of Captain Levee&rsquo;s officers, with whom I had
picked up an acquaintance, when on his calling me by the name
of Musgrave, a pinched-up sort of looking personage, in a black
suit, who was standing at the bay-window, turned round, and
coming up to me said, &ldquo;Sir, as a stranger I must apologize, but
hearing your friend call you by the name of Musgrave, may I
venture to ask if you are any relative to Sir Richard Musgrave,
Baronet, who lived in Cumberland?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
&ldquo;Lived, did you say, Sir? Is he then dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir; he has been dead these last seven months, and
we are looking out for his heir and cannot find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew the family very well,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;for I am connected
with it. His eldest son, Richard, of course, must be his
heir, as all the estates are entailed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His eldest son, Richard, Sir, is dead. We have authenticated
documents to prove that; and, moreover, his second son,
Charles, is also dead. He came home very ill and died, not at
his father&rsquo;s house, but at the house of one of his tenants on the
estate. It is his third son, Alexander Musgrave, whom we seek,
and seek in vain. He is now the heir to the baronetcy and estates,
but we have lost all clue to him. We understand that a Captain
Philip Musgrave is just arrived from the West Indies. He is, we
presume, the fourth son. But until we can find out what has
become of Alexander Musgrave, and whether he is dead or alive,
we cannot act. I have written this day to Captain Musgrave, requesting
any information he can give, but have received no answer.
I presume, Sir, it is useless to inquire of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Sir, for I am the Alexander Musgrave you
seek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sir, but what proof have you of your identity to offer
to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The evidence of my brother, Captain Philip Musgrave, in
whose ship I have just arrived from the West Indies; that his
answer to your letter will be satisfactory enough, I have no doubt.
Here is a letter from him to me, in which you see he addresses
me &lsquo;my dear Alexander,&rsquo; and concludes with &lsquo;your affectionate
brother, Philip Musgrave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is indeed, satisfactory, Sir,&rdquo; replied the gentleman,
&ldquo;and I have only to receive an answer from your brother to make
all right and clear. Allow me, Sir, to congratulate you upon
your accession to the title and property. I presume you will have
no objection, as soon as the necessary proofs are obtained, to
accompany me down to Cumberland, where I doubt not you will
be recognized by many.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
&ldquo;Of that, Sir, I have not the slightest doubt,&rdquo; replied I,
&ldquo;but I cannot go down with you to Cumberland at present. I
leave London for Liverpool the day after to-morrow on important
business, and cannot disappoint the parties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir, it must indeed be an important business which
will prevent you from taking possession of a title and &pound;4,000 per
annum,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;but here is my address, and I hope I
shall hear from you as soon as possible, as I shall remain in town
till I can bring the heir down with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man now looked as if he doubted me. He could not
imagine that I could neglect the taking possession of the estate
for any other business, and it did appear singular, so I said to
him, &ldquo;Sir, I have been long out of England, and am affianced
to a young lady who lives near Liverpool. She has been waiting
to hear from me for some time, and I have sent an express to say
that I will be with her on such a day. I cannot disappoint her,
and, I tell you more, that, without I possess her, the possession
of the title and estates will give me very little pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied he, making a bow, &ldquo;I honour your sentiments,
and she must be a worthy lady who can inspire such
feelings. I only hope that you will not remain too long at Liverpool,
as London is expensive, and I am anxious to return to
Cumberland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then wished the gentleman farewell, and went home to my
lodgings. I had given him my address in case he wanted to see
me before my departure.</p>

<p>The next day I received a letter from Philip inclosing the one
written to him by this gentleman, whose name was Campbell,
and who was a lawyer. Philip told me what reply he had made to
him, and congratulated me on my accession to the title and estates.
Almost an hour afterwards Mr. Campbell called upon me
with Philip&rsquo;s letter, which he declared to be highly satisfactory,
and sufficient in any court of justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would wish to ask you a few particulars.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
&ldquo;And I also would wish to make a few inquiries, Mr. Campbell.
I have heard your name in my youth, although I cannot
recollect ever having seen you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the confidential adviser of your father at one time,
Sir,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but latterly all intercourse had ceased; it
was not until he was on his death-bed, and fully repented the
foolish step which he had taken, and the injustice he had been
guilty of, that he sent for me, much to the annoyance of Lady
Musgrave, who would have prevented me from coming into the
house even when I arrived, had it not been for the servants, who
disobeyed her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my sisters, Sir, Janet and Mabel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are both well, and have grown up very fine girls. Your father
destroyed the deed by which Lady Musgrave was to have had
a large jointure upon the estate, and she is now entirely dependent
upon you for what she may receive. When do you expect to
be able to come up from Liverpool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hardly say, but of course as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir, my own affairs will require my presence in the
metropolis for a month. In the meantime, although I should
have preferred to have gone down with you to Faristone Hall, and
have at once put you in possession, yet affairs may remain as
they are (for every thing is under seal, and Lady Musgrave has
been compelled to remove), till it suits your convenience. I
shall, however, write to let them know that you have been found,
and will soon come down and take possession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell then asked me a few questions, to which I
replied satisfactorily, and then for the first time he saluted
me with my title, saying, &ldquo;Sir Alexander, I will now take my
leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning I set off on my journey, and travelled with
as much speed as the horses would permit. I arrived on the fifth
day at Mr. Trevannion&rsquo;s seat, about nine miles from Liverpool.
As I rode up the avenue of chestnut trees, I perceived a female
form looking out from an upper window, which soon afterwards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>
made a precipitate retreat. I alighted, and was received at the
door in the embrace of Mr. Trevannion, who welcomed me with
tears, and taking me by the hand he led me into an apartment
where I found my adored Amy, who threw herself into my arms
and wept as if her heart would break; but her sobs were the sobs
of joy, and when she did raise her head and look at me, it was
with eyes beaming with pleasure, and with smiles upon her
beautiful lips. I clasped her to my bosom, and felt that I was
more than repaid for all I had suffered, and my heart was throbbing
with gratitude and love.</p>

<p>It was some time before we could sufficiently compose ourselves
to enter into lengthened conversation, and then Amy inquired
what had occurred to me to occasion such a lengthened
absence. We sat down on a sofa, and with Amy on one side of
me and her father on the other, I entered into my narrative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you have been married since we last heard from
you?&rdquo; said Amy, smiling, when I had finished my history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;I have been; but I hope I shall treat my
second wife a little better than I did my first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so too,&rdquo; replied Amy; &ldquo;but I have great fear that
your Virginian mistress may come over and claim you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think that likely. From the Indians having followed
me to the beach, they must have fallen in with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you think became of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I cannot exactly say; but I presume she died
gallantly, and fought with her axe to the last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening I had a long conversation with Mr. Trevannion.
He told me what he had done with the money, which he considered
as mine, and I put into his care the sum I had received for
the diamond. I then spoke to him about our marriage, and requested
that it might not be postponed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Musgrave,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my daughter&rsquo;s happiness
so depends upon her union with you, that I can only say I am
willing that it should take place to-morrow. For yourself you
know that I have the highest esteem, and that you must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
convinced of when I have consented to the match without even
making inquiry as to your family and connections. Now, however,
is the time that I should wish to have some information
about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir, if you will only make inquiries, you will find
that the family of Musgrave is one of the most highly connected in
the north, and that the head of it is a or was Sir Richard Musgrave,
Baronet, of Faristone Hall, in Cumberland. I am a near
relative of his, as I can satisfactorily prove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is sufficient,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion. &ldquo;I shall leave
you to plead your cause with Amy to-morrow; so now, good
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following day I told Amy that, since my arrival in England,
I had heard of the death of my father, and that it was necessary
that I should go to the north, as family affairs required
my presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; replied she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never more so in my life. My presence is absolutely necessary,
and I made arrangements with the legal adviser of our
family that I would be there in less than a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a long journey,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion, &ldquo;and how long
to you stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot possibly say,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but not longer
than I can help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think that I shall let you go,&rdquo; said Amy; &ldquo;you are
not to be trusted out of sight. You are so born for adventure
that you will not be heard of again for another two years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such is my misfortune, I grant,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but, Amy,
you look pale and thin; change of air would do you much service.
Suppose you and your father were to come with me.
Indeed, Mr. Trevannion, I am in earnest. At this delightful
time of the year nothing would prove so beneficial to her health;
and, Amy, then, you know, that I shall not be out of your
sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like the tour very much,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
&ldquo;I know what you would say. You do not like the idea of
travelling with me as Amy Trevannion. You are right. Then
let me propose that you travel with me as Amy Musgrave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I second that proposal,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevannion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consent, Amy, let our marriage be quite private. I know
you will prefer that it should be so, and so will your father. You
will then travel with me as my wife, and we never shall part
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amy did not reply till her father said, &ldquo;Amy, it is my wish
that it should be so. Recollect it will be the last time that you
have to obey your father, so do not annoy me by a refusal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not, my dear father,&rdquo; replied Amy, kissing him.
&ldquo;Your last command I obey with pleasure. And oh! if I have
sometimes been a wilful girl, forgive me every thing at this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child, I have nothing to forgive. May God bless
you; and, Mr. Musgrave,&rdquo; said he, putting her hand in mine,
&ldquo;if she proves as good a wife as she has been a daughter, you now
receive a treasure,&rdquo; and I felt that the old man stated what was
true.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the marriage should take place on that
day week, and that it should be quite private. There was no
parade of bridal clothes; in fact, no one was invited, and it was
at my request quite a secret marriage. A clergyman had been
engaged to perform the ceremony, and, on the day appointed,
I received the hand of my Amy in the drawing-room, and in the
presence only of Humphrey and two other confidential servants.</p>

<p>After the ceremony was over, the clergyman requested me to
come with him into the adjoining room, and said, it was
necessary that he should give a certificate of the marriage, which
must be inserted in the parish register. He had called me aside
for that purpose, that I might give him my exact name, profession,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Alexander Musgrave, as you have heard when
you married us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, I know that, but I must be particular. Have you no
other name? Is that the name that you have been and will be in
future known by?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I have been known by that name,
but in future shall not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what am I to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must say, Sir Alexander Musgrave, Baronet, of
Faristone Hall, Cumberland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is what I required; and the lady
your wife, has she any other name but Amy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clergyman then wrote out the marriage certificate, and
signed it, taking a copy for registry, and we returned into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the certificate of marriage, Madam,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it
ought to be in the care of the lady, and therefore, my lady, I
hand it over to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lady is much obliged to you for your kindness,&rdquo; replied
Amy, for she thought that the clergyman was only facetious.</p>

<p>She held the certificate in her hand folded as it had been given
her for some time. At last curiosity, or, perhaps, having nothing
else to do, induced her to open it and read it. I was at
this time talking with the clergyman, and presenting him with a
handsome douceur for his trouble; but perceiving her to open the
certificate, I watched her countenance. She read and started.
I turned away as if not observing her. She then went up to her
father and desired him to read it.</p>

<p>The old gentleman took out his glasses, and it was amusing
to see the way in which he looked at his daughter with his spectacles
falling off his nose. He then came up, and pointing to
the certificate said, &ldquo;Pray how am I in future to address my
daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Amy, I trust, Sir, unless you wish to scold her, and
then you must call her Lady Musgrave. I am, my dear Sir, as
the certificate states, Sir Alexander Musgrave, of Faristone,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
with a handsome property descended to me. I did not know it
till I arrived in London, and if I concealed it from you till now,
it was only that my Amy should have the satisfaction of proving
to me that she wedded me in pure disinterestedness of
affection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very, very kind of you, Alexander, to do as you
have done, and I thank you sincerely for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear Amy, you understand why I wished you
to come with me to Cumberland, that you may take possession of
your future abode, and assume that position in society which you
will so much grace. I trust, Sir,&rdquo; continued I, &ldquo;that you will
not part from us, and that one roof will always cover us, as long
as Heaven thinks fit to spare our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God bless you both,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevannion, &ldquo;I cannot
part with you, and must follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About half an hour after this, I requested Amy and Mr. Trevannion
to sit by me, as I had now another narrative to give them,
which was an explanation why and how it was that they found me
in the position that they had done; in short, what were the causes
that induced me, and afterwards my brother Philip, to quit our
parental roof, and to come to the resolution of fighting our own
way in the world. It was as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Richard Musgrave, my father, married a young lady of
high connection, a Miss Arabella Johnson, and with her lived,
I have every reason to believe, a very happy life for nearly twenty-five
years, when it pleased God to summon her away. I have a
good recollection of my mother; for although I lived with my
brother at a private tutor&rsquo;s, about six miles off, I was continually
at home, and she did not die till I was nearly sixteen; and I can
only say, that a more elegant, amiable, and truly virtuous woman,
as I believe, never existed. By this marriage my father
had four sons and two daughters; Richard, the eldest; Charles,
the second; myself, the third; and Philip, the fourth; and my
sisters, who came last, were named Janet and Mabel. At the
time of my mother&rsquo;s death, my eldest brother was serving with
the army, which he had entered from a love of the profession,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
although, as heir to the baronetcy and estates, which are a clear
4,000<i>l.</i> per annum, he of course had no occasion for a profession.
My second brother, Charles, being of an adventurous turn, had
gone out to the East Indies in a high position, as servant to the
Company. I was still at home, as well as Philip, who is four
years my junior, and my sisters were of course at home. I pass
over my regrets at my mother&rsquo;s death, and will now speak more
of my father. He was a good-tempered, weak man, easily led,
and although, during my mother&rsquo;s lifetime, he was so well led
that it was of little consequence, the case proved very different at
her death. For a year my father remained quiet in the house,
content with superintending his improvements on his property,
and he had lately become infirm, and had given up the hounds
and rural sports in general. The dairy was one of his principal
hobbies; and it so happened that a young girl, the daughter of
a labourer, was one of the females employed in that part of the
establishment. She was certainly remarkably good-looking; her
features were very small, and she did not show that robust frame
which people in her class of life generally do. She was about
seventeen years old, slight in figure, and certainly a person that
you would not pass without making some commendatory remark
upon her good looks and modest appearance. She was not, however,
what she appeared; she was beyond measure cunning and
astute, and, as it proved, inordinately ambitious. My father,
who was naturally of an amorous disposition, was attracted by
her, and very soon was constantly in the dairy, and his attentions
were so marked, that the other servants used to call her
&lsquo;my lady.&rsquo; A few months after my father had shown a preference
for this girl, he was seized with his first attack of
gout. It did not last him long, and in six weeks he was about
again, and resumed his attentions to her. Philip and I, who
were at our tutor&rsquo;s, when we came home, heard from others
what was going on, and very foolishly played the girl many
tricks, and annoyed her as much as we could. After we returned,
my father had another fit of the gout, and when he was confined
to his room, he desired this girl to be sent for to attend upon him.
I cannot say what took place, but this is certain, that my father&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
unfortunate passion became so great, and I presume the girl&rsquo;s
ambition rose in proportion, that about six months afterwards,
this daughter of a menial was raised to the dignity of Lady
Musgrave&mdash;she being at that time about eighteen, and my father
verging on seventy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When this ill-assorted and disgraceful connection was
known, the gentry and aristocracy of the county refused any
longer to visit my father, and all communication was broken off.
In a short time the ascendency which this artful girl gained over
the old man was most wonderful. He lived but in her sight, and
knew no will but hers. Her father and family were removed to a
good house in the neighbourhood, and gave themselves all the
airs of gentlepeople. The good old steward was dismissed, and
her father established in his room, although the man could not
read or write, and was wholly unfit for the office. The expense
which she launched out into, by his permission, was excessive.
New liveries, new coaches, diamonds, and dresses fit for the
court&mdash;indeed, every kind of luxury that could be conceived,
and much greater than my father could afford. She now showed
herself in her true colours; vindictive and tyrannical to excess,
she dismissed all the old servants, and oppressed all those to
whom she owed a grudge; yet my poor father could see nothing
but perfection in her. It was not till four months after the marriage
that Philip and I came home, and our new step-mother had
not forgotten our treatment of her. She treated us with great
harshness, refused our taking meals at my father&rsquo;s table, and
ordered us the coarsest fare; and when we complained to my
father, denied every thing that we said. As we found that we
could not induce our father to listen to us or to believe us, we
tried all we could, and retaliated and annoyed her as much, if
not more, than she annoyed us, by talking of her mean origin
and her former occupation; we defied her, and, in so doing, we
ruined ourselves; for, after a useless struggle on my father&rsquo;s
part, he gave way to her imperious commands, and sending for
me, told me that I had become such a reprobate that I was no
longer a son of his. He threw me a purse, telling me that it was
all I might expect from him, and that I was instantly to leave the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>
house, and never show my face in it any more. I replied,
with more spirit than respect, that it was high time that the son of
a gentleman and lady should leave the house, when such lowborn
creatures were installed in it as the mistress. My father,
in a rage, flung his crutch at my head, and I left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I went out I met her in the passage; she had evidently
been listening to what had passed, and she was full of exultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is your turn now, you she-devil,&rsquo; said I, in my rage;
&lsquo;but wait till my father dies. You shall go a-milking again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to defend my conduct, but I was then no
seventeen, and that must be my excuse. I little thought, when
I said so, that it would be from my hands that she would have to
receive bounty, but so it is, as Mr. Campbell informs me that my
father destroyed, previous to his death, the papers which he had
signed to secure her a large jointure on the estate. I set off with
my wardrobe and the purse of twenty guineas, which my father
had given me, and having a desire to see the world, I went on
board of a merchant vessel. Six months afterwards, when we
were at Liverpool, I went on board of a privateer. The remainder
of my history you are already acquainted with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as she had wreaked her vengeance upon me, my
brother Philip was the next; but he was too young at that time to
be turned adrift, so she put it off till the time should come, irritating
and weaning my father from him by every means in her
power. Three years afterwards she succeeded in having him dismissed,
also, and you know how I found him out. All these circumstances
were very well known in the neighbourhood and to
our own relations; and one only, my aunt, called upon my father,
and, after a long conversation, my father consented that my
sisters should go away, and remain under her charge. My step-mother&rsquo;s
violent temper, her exactions, her imperious conduct,
which was now shown even towards him, with what my aunt had
advanced, had to a certain extent opened my father&rsquo;s eyes. He
perceived that she had no other view but her own aggrandisement,
and that she cared little for him. Her repeated attempts,
however, to make him sign in her favour, in case of his death,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>
were successful, and it was not till after her conduct had alienated
him from her, and he deplored the loss of his children, that
he committed the deed to the flames. About three years after I
had quitted the house, my eldest brother, who had information
of all that had passed, and who remained in the army because he
declared that he never would go home till after his father&rsquo;s death,
was killed by a cannon-ball; and my second brother died of a
fever about a year ago, when resident at the court of a native
prince. I had heard nothing of these deaths, or of my father&rsquo;s,
until my arrival in London; of course, I was most anxious to go
down to Cumberland, if it were only to undo the wickedness
which this woman had done, and to make amends to those whom
she had so cruelly treated. I do not feel any spirit of revenge,
but I feel that justice demands it of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall go with you with pleasure, to help you in your
good work,&rdquo; said Amy, &ldquo;and also because I want to see how she
will now behave to one whom she has so persecuted, and who has
become the arbiter of her fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Amy, I will not trust myself on this question. You
shall be the arbitress of her fate, and what you decide shall be
irrevocable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fully appreciate the compliment you pay me,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;but I prefer that it should be decided in council, and we will
call in my father to our assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fortnight after our marriage, we set off for London, in a
coach with six handsome black horses, and eight armed servants
in liveries on horseback. We arrived safely on the seventh day,
and there we reposed for a time previous to setting out for Cumberland.
My aunt was in London and attending the court, which
I was not aware of, and with her were my two sisters, Janet and
Mabel, whom I had not seen for years, and who warmly embraced
me, promising that they would soon come down and take
up their abode at the hall. They expressed their admiration of
Amy, but, in so doing, they only followed the general opinion,
for it was impossible to see and not admire her elegance and
beauty. My aunt showed us every attention, and we were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>
presented to his Majesty, who was pleased to compliment Lady
Musgrave in very flattering terms. We were joined in London by
my brother Philip, who had paid off his ship, and the day after
he joined us I said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip, there are only you and I left. Do you recollect when
you inquired about the diamond, the day we met on board of
your ship, what reply I made to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you said that you were afraid that you could not afford
to make me a present of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time I did not think so, Philip, but now I know that
I can, and I have desired Mr. Trevannion to put out to good security
the &pound;38,000 that the diamond was sold for, in your name,
and for your use. You&rsquo;ll not hesitate to accept it, Philip, for
you know that I can afford it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not hesitate, my dear Alexander, because I would do
the same to you, and you would not refuse me. At the same
time, that is no reason that I should not thank you kindly for your
generous behaviour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip accompanied us on our journey to Cumberland. It was
tedious, for the roads were any thing but good, but the beauty of
the scenery compensated for the ruggedness of the way. In six
days we arrived at the Hall, where Mr. Campbell, who had called
upon me on my arrival in London, had preceded me to make preparations
for our reception, which was enthusiastic to the highest
degree. We were called upon and congratulated by all the
county, who were delighted to find that such a personage as Amy
was to be the future mistress.</p>

<p>As soon as all this bustle and excitement were over, I sat
down with Mr. Campbell to look over the state of affairs, and to
set things to rights.</p>

<p>After having done justice to many claimants, engaged again
the old servants that had been discharged, promised farms to the
tenants who had been unfairly turned out, &amp;c., we then proceeded
to decide upon what was to be done to the Dowager Lady
Musgrave. It appears that at my father&rsquo;s death, when she found
that the deed had been destroyed by his own hands in presence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
others, she became frantic with rage, and immediately hastened
to secure the family jewels, and every article of value that she
could lay her hands upon, but Mr. Campbell, having due notice
of what she was about, came in time to prevent her taking them
away, and, putting seals upon every thing and leaving careful
guards in the Hall, my lady had gone to her father&rsquo;s house, where
she still remained. She had, on my arrival, sent me a message,
imploring my mercy, and reminding me that whatever might be
her errors, she was still the lawful wife of my father, and she
trusted that respect to his memory would induce me to allow her
sufficient to maintain her as Lady Musgrave should be. We had
the consultation that Amy proposed, and called in Mr. Campbell
as a fourth, and it was at last decided, that, on consideration
that she removed with her family to a distance of fifty miles from
Faristone, she should have an income of &pound;300 per annum, as
long as she conducted herself with propriety and did not marry
again. The last clause was the only one which she complained of.
Mr. Campbell had, at the request of my father, discharged Lady
Musgrave&rsquo;s parent from the office of steward and called in the old
steward to resume his situation, and before dismissal, he had
to refund certain sums of money not accounted for.</p>

<p>I have now told my eventful tale; I have only to add, that after
all that I have passed through, I have been rewarded by many
years of unalloyed happiness. My two sisters are well married,
and my three children are all that a father could wish. Such, my
dear Madam, have been the vicissitudes of a &ldquo;Privateer&rsquo;s-man,&rdquo;
and I now subscribe myself,</p>

<p class="center">Your most obedient,</p>

<p class="sig">Alexander Musgrave.</p>
